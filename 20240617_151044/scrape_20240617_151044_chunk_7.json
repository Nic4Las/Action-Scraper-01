And so, already under suspicion from the stigmata which has marked him from birth, Alunya's prodigal talents quickly provoke scorn and distrust. After all, What use did any in such peaceful times have for power?\nYet Alunya and Antares are not under threat of merely their lives, but their very souls, in a world eager to twist them into a reflection of their surroundings. The question remains open if Alunya will even survive to see the future he dreams of... And perhaps more importantly, if he does, will any part of his or his brothers' innocence still be intact to see it?\n[...]\nStory is written in third person limited, present tense, from the perspectives of the two main characters (Alunya and Antares) with very few exceptions. I would describe the genre as slow-burn character drama, with adventure elements only far later into the story. Upload schedule will be biweekly for the time being, as of posting the first chapter I have 35 more chapters ready to go and am still writing more, hopefully that backlog is enough to keep it going at a consistent schedule for a very long time.","description_hash":-8293933698853941833},{"title":"Fire and Ice","fiction_id":"86740","link":"https:\/\/www.royalroad.com\/fiction\/86740\/fire-and-ice","tags":["Urban Fantasy","Non-Human Lead","Contemporary","Fantasy","Supernatural","Female Lead","Magic","Low Fantasy","Attractive Lead"],"lable":"Original","following_count":8,"rating":4.5,"page_count":781,"view_count":8115,"chapters_count":88,"last_update":1718575233,"description":"In the Supernatural world lies the Werewolf world.

Finnian was born to a family of scholars on a planet long consumed by its star. His one lingering regret in life was that he had not been able to enjoy the little things more. He had toiled away for eons on his academic pursuits, but once he had time to reflect on things, he realized that it was all meaningless. As the tapestries of the cosmos began to gradually unravel, he knew that the meaning of life was not to embroil himself in studies but to enjoy the uniqueness of life and go on an adventure. With the universe itself dying, its secrets were slipping away into the void, forever beyond his reach so pursuing knowledge had no more merits anyways. Left with the remaining time he had left, he had decided to go on one final journey to enjoy the splendors the world had to offer. Although Finnian's age had long surpassed what any mortal could achieve, his mind was not entirely whole. Living for so long would inevitably impose bouts of madness on any person.

However, no one ever knew about the final battle except the other top guild leaders. The speculation across the domain is that Rezhura and his squad halfway succeeded in killing Mauro, but due to an unknown reason, they were forced to retreat and left King Mauro's place.\nIn the exact same year, Kyren found himself by the riverside without any memory of the past. Luckily, he met a very kind and helpful person named Hiro. They got along and helped each other; Hiro helped Kyren regain his memory, while Kyren helped Hiro achieve his dream of becoming part of the Sacred Selection Guild.\nKyren and Hiro take on a journey to become warriors and climb to the top. However, each step revealed how their optimistic outlook unfolded the truth about their sinister world.\n--\nED3 Book 1: \"Tales of the Perfect Knight\" features two main characters. Rezhura is a renowned hero of the world who fights against evildoers and breaks all evil deeds to cleanse their evil domain. He has everything, especially his trustworthy Royal Squad consisting of six godly individuals. In contrast, Kyren is the opposite of all this; he has nothing, including his memories from the past.\n\nNew chapters are released every Monday and Thursday.\nP.S.: This story consists of three books so far, but they are in my native language.

She can do things other people simply can't. She is stronger and faster than anyone she has ever met, to the point that her friends view her as superhuman. Despite her powers, the world has not been kind to Ardia. Growing up in the care of one of Armenia's foremost criminal bosses, she and her powers have been used to further the needs of a criminal organization that draws wealth from drugs, arms dealing, and prostitution. To make matters worse, her mother has just been murdered. Not just murdered, but savagely and brutally attacked in a bizarre and seemingly random incident. Now, with the help of the criminal known as Razmik, Ardia is seeking to bring her mother's killer to justice. What she doesn't know is that this killer is even stranger than she is. Why was her mother killed so horribly? What is that blurry shape in the surveillance photograph? Can it really be something other than a human? And what is the reason for her own abilities, powers that no one has ever seen, let alone explained?Meanwhile, half a world away, Homer is setting out on a similar quest. Raised in the jungle by a Catholic missionary with a brutal past, Homer is anything but normal himself. Also imbued with strange abilities and an even stranger appearance, Homer is about to step into the civilized world for the first time on his mission to find his father. What Homer doesn't know is that this mission will lead him to find out more about his own origins, his own primal instinct, and his own emotions than he ever wanted to discover. Who is his father? Where did he go twenty years ago after Homer was conceived? What is the real story behind his mother's death? And who really is Father O'Connor, the man who raised him and a man who seems to have the darkest past of all? Ardia and Homer have each set out on their paths, each for their reasons. Each of our heroes is spectacularly different from ordinary humans, but the challenges and discoveries they will meet will affect them just as deeply as they would any normal soul. This is the story of how their separate paths will come to cross.","description_hash":5831486486243071252},{"title":"Dark Matter - Earth","fiction_id":"86627","link":"https:\/\/www.royalroad.com\/fiction\/86627\/dark-matter-earth","tags":["Post Apocalyptic","Xianxia","Fantasy"],"lable":"Original","following_count":0,"rating":0.0,"page_count":4,"view_count":49,"chapters_count":1,"last_update":1715832889,"description":"In a world where the mysteries of dark matter remain elusive, Dr. Jensen, a lead physicist, and his team make a groundbreaking discovery.

For a long time, the mythologies, prophecies, and philosophies of the East and the West seemed separate and distinct, but as time progressed, these boundaries blurred. It was in this moment that the protagonist, Han Xuan, an ordinary city worker, found himself drawn into a grand and unpredictable adventure.\nAfter an unexpected accident in Beijing, Han Xuan discovered he had a unique connection to an ancient prophecy. Professor Wang Bin from the Institute of Life Sciences revealed to him an ancient Taoist text containing references to the \"Ten-Thousand-Year Heavenly Calamity,\" a cyclical force whose appearance signaled a dramatic shift in the world. Simultaneously, the Western text \"Book of Revelation\" contained a similar warning, hinting at the coming apocalypse. Han Xuan's destiny was thus intertwined with these two prophecies.\nThis call of fate brought together extraordinary individuals from different backgrounds. In Shandong's Laoshan, he met Yuan Dun Shangren, a wise sage who helped Han Xuan understand the mysteries of Eastern philosophy and provided him with secret techniques to withstand the Heavenly Calamity. In Beijing, the formidable Taoist master Wang Yong used his profound Taoist skills to support Han Xuan. In the United States, adventurer Ikelus George introduced him to the truths behind Western prophecies and legends.\nHowever, the most astonishing encounter for Han Xuan was with Furli, a beautiful woman from the fifth dimension. This enigmatic figure not only brought knowledge and power from another realm but also guided Han Xuan toward discovering the true nature of his destiny. With her assistance, Han Xuan's perspective expanded significantly, revealing that his mission was more complex than he had imagined. Meanwhile, his friend Yue Nannan became his emotional anchor, providing him with endless motivation in this extraordinary world.\nThroughout this grand adventure, Han Xuan realized that he not only had to face challenges from ancient prophecies but also had to contend with threats from the real world. Alongside a group of brave and unique allies, he explored sacred lands, unraveled hidden mysteries, and ultimately sought the hope for world peace.\nThis is an epic adventure that spans time and space, imbued with boundless wisdom and courage. On this legendary journey, Han Xuan would discover his own potential and, amidst the turmoil of the world, write his own immortal chapter.","description_hash":-1956712530210687500},{"title":"Rise of the mad archer","fiction_id":"86574","link":"https:\/\/www.royalroad.com\/fiction\/86574\/rise-of-the-mad-archer","tags":["Progression","War and Military","Male Lead","Strong Lead","Action","Adventure","Fantasy","Mystery","Supernatural","Magic","High Fantasy","Mythos","Ruling Class"],"lable":"Original","following_count":8,"rating":4.67,"page_count":136,"view_count":1550,"chapters_count":18,"last_update":1717902158,"description":"On an island in the middle of the world, Okimodo is an Azurai clan boy about to undergo his rite of passage to become a man.

However, tragedy struck when they went on a mission in enemy territory and were presumed dead despite the lack of any evidence of their demise. Due to their parents' considerable wealth and inheritance, Elion and his younger sister, Alexa, were kicked out of the Great Hayes family by their uncles and aunts, blinded by greed, and had no sympathy for the siblings' plight.\n====THIS STORY IS ABOUT PEOPLE WITH ELEMENTAL POWER (FIRE,WATER,WIND,EARTH AND STEEL), WAR AGAINST DEMONS, WAR AGAINST EMPIRES, WITH RANK AND LEVELING SYSTEM.=====\nWhile searching for a fresh start, they moved to the Waste District, where they formed an unbreakable bond with three companions who eventually became their family: Laxus, Wendy, and Kael.

It was revealed that the demons who had attacked Solara ten thousand years ago were about to return; this time, they were much stronger and brutal. The responsibility of defending Solara now rests on their shoulders.\nDespite the looming threat of danger, there was no news of the new Elemental Guardians of Solara returning to defend their land.
