He, along with other children, is kidnapped and raised to serve under the infamous House Bathory as spies and assassins. Their mission? Infiltrate their eternal rivals and orchestrate the heist of the century: Stealing the Crown fragment that turned heroes into kings and nations into an empire.\nIn this ruthless world, ambition and cunning are survival tools, whether you're in the wild, on the battlefield, or navigating royal courts. Secrets act as currency, and a seemingly simple power play can conceal a century-old plot that transcends space and time.\nTorn between his quest to protect his loved ones and his morality, Kal's humanity will be put to the test as he navigates through political struggles greater than himself. Immersed in a suicide mission that could disrupt the foundation of a society on the brink of implosion, he quickly realizes that failure goes beyond death.\n\n\n\nHey I'm L:1. This is my first try at online writing and there is a short list of what to expect from this story.\n\nWhat to expect:\n- Character building\n- Martial art oriented action with a power system\n- Betrayals, schemes, and mysteries\n- Dark scenes\n- Worldbuilding\n- Slice of life including comedy and romance\n-Slow burn\n\n\n\nNotes: This world and story have been brewing for a long time. I can confirm that a lot of it comes from my love for heist and old martial arts movies haha. English isn't my first language but I trained hard to be able to be completely fluent and I'm happy to finally be able to write with minimal fears. The plot will take its time to truly kick in. To install the roots of key narratives properly, the story will start at Kallen's kidnapping. The goal is a coming-of-age\/rise-to-power origin story from start to finish.\nOh and for my reincarnator aficionados, I decided to execute it with a little twist that should appear fairly early in the story.\nFeel free to tell me what you think and I hope you can have an enjoyable time.\nL:1\n\n\n**Updating on Sundays (Thursday too when backlog allows it)**","description_hash":-9181335995175838770},{"title":"Divine Playthings: The God's Isekai Experiment","fiction_id":"88648","link":"https:\/\/www.royalroad.com\/fiction\/88648\/divine-playthings-the-gods-isekai-experiment","tags":["Portal Fantasy \/ Isekai","Female Lead","Fantasy","Short Story","Male Lead"],"lable":"Original","following_count":0,"rating":0.0,"page_count":2,"view_count":39,"chapters_count":1,"last_update":1718597625,"description":"Synopsis:\nIn the celestial realm of Elysium, where time flows differently and cosmic beings oversee galaxies like a grand tapestry, resides an ancient and somewhat bored deity known simply as the Game Master.
