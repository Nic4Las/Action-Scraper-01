Some characters swear in thoughts. And I'm pretty sure that you'll find along the way some characters that swear in action. 99% of the time it will be more about their way to express stress and state of mind rather than to express the literal meaning of their swear. 1% of the time, characters will be assholes.\nSexual content - For now it\u2019s not planned to appear before much further down the line.

But instead of worrying about my first day jitters, I found myself in a real-life nightmare \u2013 trapped in a chilling ritual chamber, surrounded by the echoes of cries and the stench of blood and old earth. It was like stepping into the worst horror game, except the iron collar around my neck and the creepy messages flooding my vision were all too real.Thrown into this bizarre, terrifying world, I had to pinch myself to believe it. Monsters, magic, chaos \u2013 it felt like a messed-up dream. But hey, a girl's got to do what a girl's got to do, right? My will to survive kicked in big time.

He is one of the immortal elves, and he knows the truth.\u00a0\nThe world before just had less people in it, and improvement comes with time. And evil?

There is a system engrained into the world, you will see it as the story progresses. Storm Chasing and forecasting are part of the system, but they are not the only domain that exists.\u00a0\nWhy did I write this?: I've always been fascinated by severe weather, and tornadoes. I think tornadoes have the closest resemblance to eldritch monsters in our real world. The culture and science that surrounds meteorology and storm chasing in general is so rich, and absolutely fits the fantasy genre. I wanted to take those raw moments of adventure and awe that one gets from storm chasing and infuse the fantasy oomph into it. Originally, I was going to write this purely as a fantasy novel, but after experimenting a ton with the world building and magic system, I realized that I would have the most fun if I attempted at creating a LITRPG system, but also have it feel more grounded into the lore of the world rather than it feel too much like a video game. This is the end result, and I can't wait to flesh it out even more as I go.\u00a0\n\n'There is no greed like Monarch greed'\nFour Hundred Years Ago, the Monarch Kings conquered the lands beyond the gates, paying no heed to the warnings of their ancestors. Their greed and their plunder awakened long dormant malevolent forces, bringing their short reigns to a very abrupt end. One by one, each of the monarch kingdoms began to fall, until the few that remained retreated back to the sovereign lands, vowing never to cross back over the gates again. \nBut the damage had already been done. An irreversible course of events had been set into motion, leading to the demise of the last Primalord, Moraftus the Muted.\nThe lord's demise had broken a seal, one that unleashed powerful tempests that tore through the Primalands, opening gateways for elder beings to seep through.\u00a0\nFrom the darkness of this era, a new breed of adventurers took to the roads. Each with their own ambitions; whether it was seeking thrill, or seeking glory, they rode up and down the lands, chasing tempests; forecasting them, documenting them and observing them to further their own understanding.\nThey were given the moniker of 'storm chasers', and thus, a new age of conquest had begun.","description_hash":7002601753792481101},{"title":"A Soul Bound, A Bargain Struck","fiction_id":"87452","link":"https:\/\/www.royalroad.com\/fiction\/87452\/a-soul-bound-a-bargain-struck","tags":["Progression","Anti-Hero Lead","Female Lead","Adventure","Fantasy","Magic"],"lable":"Original","following_count":1,"rating":0.0,"page_count":23,"view_count":162,"chapters_count":2,"last_update":1717051555,"description":"Whoever said hell was hot is a gods-damned liar.\nSure there were probably other regions of hell, lower circles that burned just as hot as the stories said, but the domain that she awoke in was not one. Instead she was stark naked in a freezing tundra that lacked even ice and snow, simply freezing stone as far as the eye could see. Well freezing stone and a single looming castle that looked formed from darkness itself. Its sheer stone walls rose like mountains on the horizon and seemed to drink in the ambient light that surrounded her as if sinking into a bottomless void. The few scattered shrubs that dotted the flat expanse that surrounded the castle, all made sure to keep their distance from the horrifying structure.\nA thought occurred to her as she took measure of her surroundings. If she was already dead, and in hell, could she freeze to death? It certainly felt like she could as her form began to shake and shiver. The cold seemed to invade her senses as she took in her bearings clawing down to her very bones. Her teeth were already chattering in the icy wind after just a minute to gather herself. Still many questions flew through her mind, but the single most shocking one was what plagued her mind with every step she took towards the looming structure, who was she?\nShe knew this was hell. She knew she was dead. But she didn't know her name? A name came to her mind but it felt wrong. \"Lilian Theridore\". No! That wasn't her name. But it was so familiar to her... Some instinctual part of her brain seemed to almost argue with her, that was not her name. Not anymore. Right. Names held power, especially with demons.\nFor a demon a name was a leash, to call upon a demon by name was to tug at their leash, something they rarely took kindly to. Giving out her name would be akin to handing another being her leash. Yet... if her name wasn't Lilian what was her name now, shouldn\u2019t a demon know its own name. Or at least, if she was in hell that made her a demon now didn\u2019t it?\nContent Warnings: This story will contain Profanity, Sexual Content, Graphic Violence, and Sensitive content. Chapters which contain these will have individual content warnings at the start of the chapter and elaborate on the types of content. As a pre-empt this will likely include sensitive themes such as: slavery, various BDSM dynamics involving the MC as both a dominant and a submissive, non-consensual sexual encounters, dubious consent, and sexual violence.

Yet, as far as anyone outside his own mind knew\u2014and for those few who might believe him\u2014Marley came into existence just like everyone else.\n\u2014\nMarley wasn\u2019t like many of his classmates at Covenwood. Introverted\u2014avoidant, more accurately\u2014he hid from others unless absolutely necessary, giving rise to rumours among his peers. Nothing malicious, he didn't think, just whispers: mute, secretive, asshole.\n\nMarley also had a rather strange appearance, albeit only strange because those around him ranged from the ages of 12 to 17. His brown hair was streaked with ginger and white, a trait he inherited from his mother but shared with none of his six siblings.\n\nBut what truly set Marley apart was his magic. He could see what others could not and had long given up trying to explain it. He saw people's souls and their lack thereof. He perceived the darkest corners of their beings, their purities, blessings, and secrets, all with one long stare. (He exaggerated this a bit, but it didn\u2019t matter\u2014no one ever believed him.)\n\u2014\nMarley was not part of any prophecy. The stars never called his name, never aligned to form his destiny, never etched sigils into the palms of his hands.
