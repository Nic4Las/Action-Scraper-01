I hope you'll enjoy it.\nA forewarning about what to expect: This book contains many triggering tropes from a darker era. Violence, foul language, and stereotypes are present. These do not reflect my views but aim to provide insight into the period. Many things you read here, though lightly represented, were true.\nThis book is not fan fiction. The allusion to the Ninja Turtles is just a nod.\nIt is a mild Lit RPG with an original System.\nThere are twists in the storyline.\nIt features a strong-to-stronger main character.\nAlbeit the action begins slowly and grows to be more intense after chapter 8, this is NOT a slow burn and will not have 10k+ chapters. The first volume has about 80k words and 40 chapters, which I'll release two or three times a week. The action moves quickly but logically, with interludes to make it clear.\nGood feedback is appreciated and will be considered for a second edition, and Kindle.

This disaster is a major healthcare opportunity for Eugenia, and other elderly citizens of the empire, because the Emperor only drafts soldiers over 62 years of age. The Imperial Army and the Imperial Conclave of the Classed have the resources and mandate to turn the aged and infirm into the raw recruits who will beat back the goblin menace.\n\nWhat to expect:\nGrannies\nGoblins\nAlchemy\n\nI actually have 8000 words of this story line down already.
