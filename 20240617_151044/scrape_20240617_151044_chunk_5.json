The stars quietly illuminate the darkness of the sky, and their light softens the hustle and bustle of the city. Very few people know the other side of this world. Many people are caught up in their daily lives and only live on the surface of what they can see. On the other hand, in the illuminated cafes and parks of the city at night, people can be seen finding the small joys in life and taking a breather.\nHowever, behind this peaceful appearance, there were those who were pursuing the truth. One of them is Satoshi Koizumi, a physicist who is passionate about the mysteries of the universe. He first became interested in science when he was young, when his mother asked him to choose his favorite book. He picked up a book that unraveled the mysteries of the universe and a book that unraveled the mysteries of the human body. These books captured his heart and opened the door to the unknown.\nOne day, just as he was leaving the laboratory, a strange person appeared in front of him and spoke incomprehensible words. This encounter becomes an opportunity to create a new mystery in the story. That person was a person who would greatly change Koizumi's destiny.\nHis journey to find the truth begins with a seemingly ordinary conversation with his childhood friend and psychiatrist Masato Matsuda, but it soon leads the story to a deep mystery. This mysterious event forges bonds with new friends, and their expertise becomes the key to unraveling the story's mysteries.\nThe curtain rises on \u201cThe False World and Those Who Chase the Truth: Memories of Another World and the Mysteries of Science.\u201d In the story, various developments await, such as battles between advanced AIs and life in another world.\nOn this journey, Koizumi meets biologist Misa Hoshi's friends, Li Wenqiang Li Wenqiang, an authority on quantum mechanics, and astrophysicist Chuama Amano's friends. Their combined expertise takes the story to a new level.\nWhen they finally found out the truth, it was far beyond their imagination. The weight of the unknown truth and the choices they make after that point their lives in a new direction.\nThey are faced with the crossroads of whether to reveal the truth to the world or remain silent. Their decisions had the potential to affect not only their own fate, but the future of all humanity. How they act after learning the truth - their choices form the final theme of this story.\nThis is a story of people torn between truth and falsehood. The ultimate question posed by this story is how the results of their quest will change their perceptions and ours.","description_hash":5764570152654197776},{"title":"Dungeon Master Dungeon Core","fiction_id":"87306","link":"https:\/\/www.royalroad.com\/fiction\/87306\/dungeon-master-dungeon-core","tags":["Portal Fantasy \/ Isekai","Dungeon","Anti-Hero Lead","Multiple Lead Characters","Fantasy","Reincarnation","Male Lead","Non-Human Lead","Magic","High Fantasy","Progression"],"lable":"Original","following_count":13,"rating":4.5,"page_count":28,"view_count":855,"chapters_count":4,"last_update":1718008928,"description":"When a DM gets isekai\u2019d mid session, he find himself reincarnated as a dungeon core.\u00a0\n~<>~ What to expect:\n\u2022 Bad writing\n\u2022 Mildly creative ideas\n\u2022 Tons of stereotypes\nNot only is this the first thing I\u2019ve ever written, but I\u2019m also not putting much effort into it.

Billy wasn't much of a shot\u2014he'd always been more comfortable with a pen than a gun\u2014but that was about to change.\n\nSheriff Jed \"Ironjaw\" Thompson leaned against the hitching post outside the saloon, a toothpick rolling between his teeth.

Jed was a legend, known for taking down entire gangs single-handedly and chewing nails for his daily intake of iron, or so the stories went. To Billy, he was a living nightmare wrapped in a duster.\n\n\"Yer late,\" Jed growled, his voice like gravel crunching underfoot. He didn't look up from the horse he was grooming, but Billy knew those eyes missed nothing.\n\n\"Sorry, Sheriff,\" Billy stammered, trying to hide the tremor in his voice. \"Got held up by the Tucker boys.\"\n\nJed snorted. \"They still sore 'bout that poker game? Told ya, if you're gonna gamble, ya better be ready to draw.\"\n\nBilly swallowed hard. He had a lot to learn, and he knew it. That's why he was here\u2014to be trained by the toughest son of a gun in the West.\n\n\"Let's get somethin' straight, kid,\" Jed said, finally turning to face him. \"This ain't about learnin' to shoot. It's about cultivatin' yer spirit. Out here, a man's soul is his true weapon. Guns are just a tool.\"\n\nBilly nodded, not entirely sure what that meant, but eager to find out. He'd heard tales of outlaws who could dodge bullets, gunfighters who could summon the very essence of the desert to fight by their side. If anyone could teach him, it was Jed.\n\n\"First lesson,\" Jed said, tossing a tin can into the air and drawing his pistol in one smooth motion. The can exploded mid-flight, shards raining down like confetti. \"Ya gotta learn to trust yerself. Fear'll kill ya faster than any bullet.\"\n\nBilly took a deep breath and drew his own gun, hands shaking. He fired, missing the tin can completely.\n\nJed sighed, shaking his head. \"We got a long way to go, kid. But we'll get there. Now, holster that iron and follow me. We got bandits to hunt, and they ain't gonna wait for ya to find yer courage.\"\n\nAs Billy followed Jed out of town, he couldn't help but feel a spark of something new\u2014a flicker of determination.

So dark, the man wondered if he'd actually gone blind. *CLAP* A bright flash of light filled everywhere, with just a tiny dark orb in front of that man. The orb's color was that of the blackest of blacks. It wasn't black because of emptiness, rather it was too dense with every single particle of reality itself. That orb made a whistling sound, like it had a consciousness, a soul. \"You want to live?\", The man whose silence could make anyone feel uneasy, finally spoke. And in reply the orb again made a different creaky sound, which otherwise meaningless, somehow sound as if it agreed. \"Then your wish I shall grant\", said the man placing his hand in front of the orb. And another bright flash, but this time with a shattering sound. The hollow, the feeling of emptiness, all was gone, a universe was formed. The dense orb that was black all this time was glowing, dimming with life. It was the very source of everything that was being created. At last, it stopped, as if its work was done, as if it were a kid waiting for their father's order. The man looked at a nearby planet, his gaze was gentle, his voice softened. \"Of all the worlds out there, I choose this one\" The man said and upon this that orb fired a bright white ray and distributed its energy all over that planet. Only a small portion of that orb remained, as a tiny violet marble. \"DIVIDE\" Said the man to the little marble which was left. And upon his words that marble split into four parts, and from each part emerged a person; Three boys and one girl. \"This world my children, is a place for you to live, to grow, a place for you to call home.\" The man continued, \"The other beings that I've given life to might be inferior to you, but always remember they are me precious children, just as you four are\". The four Gods nodded in agreement. The man smiled. \"Agni, Astra, Chakra, Kaal; Protect this world, as it is truly adored by me.

It is said that long before our world took shape, a great void gave birth to the essence of time itself, marking the beginning of an age of wonders and terrors. From this void emerged a chaotic force, a primordial swirl that danced and clashed, giving rise to life in its myriad forms. Among these early beings was Gaea, a titan of creation, whose touch sparked the birth of light and darkness, knowledge and mystery.\nAs eons passed, Gaea's hand shaped not only the elements of fire, earth, water, and air, but also the vibrant and tumultuous beings that would inhabit this fledgling world. Yet, chaos reigned supreme, birthing monstrous entities that roamed unchecked, their very existence a testament to the wild, untamed energies from which they sprang. In this era of discord, death emerged as a necessary balance, a force to temper the unchecked proliferation of life.\nLegends tell of Gaea's twin, Gaia, who in a moment of cosmic divergence, chose to sleep, allowing the forces of creation to mold Earth into a cradle for burgeoning life. While Gaia dreamt, Gaea grew restless, her gaze turning towards the lifeforms of Earth. With a mixture of envy and curiosity, Gaea began to steal these creatures, transporting them to her own realm, a land she named Terra. There, she embarked on a grand experiment, modifying these lifeforms into beings of myth and legend.\nIn the twilight between dreams and reality, pathways were forged between Earth and Terra, allowing beings to traverse the thin veil that separated the worlds. Dragons soared across the skies of Terra, while the first humans, beastmen, orcs, and other fantastical races began to populate this new world. Among them, human gods emerged, beings of immense power who commanded the respect and fear of all who dwelt there. It was a time of great heroes and unspeakable evils, where the boundaries between mortal and the divine were fluid and ever-changing.\nBut as with all great epochs, a cataclysm loomed on the horizon. Gaea's grand experiment reached a critical point, and the once vibrant Terra began to fracture. Wars erupted, madness spread, and the very essence of power itself became a double-edged sword. In a desperate bid to preserve the world she had shaped, Gaea enacted a sealing spell, entombing races, locking away gods, and splitting the very land itself. Terra Zular, as it came to be known, entered a long, dark slumber, hidden from the eyes of both men and gods.\nYet, nothing stays buried forever. Whispers speak of seals breaking, ancient gods stirring, and the forgotten world awakening once more. Those who claim to know of such things suggest that the line between myth and reality is thinner than we might believe. Perhaps the teller of these tales is not just a mere storyteller but a keeper of secrets, a bridge between our world and the obscured realm of Terra Zular. And as the shadows lengthen and the old powers stir, we are reminded that the boundaries of our world are not as fixed as they seem, and the legends of old may yet come to life.","description_hash":1071073647980531510},{"title":"Blossom","fiction_id":"87380","link":"https:\/\/www.royalroad.com\/fiction\/87380\/blossom","tags":["Male Lead","Action","Adventure","Fantasy","Magic","High Fantasy"],"lable":"Original","following_count":0,"rating":0.0,"page_count":32,"view_count":180,"chapters_count":4,"last_update":1718371863,"description":"The era of the Undulaar has ended, leaving the Five Kingdoms united under the Unela banner.

Her reputation precedes her, for she is often called \u201cwillful,\u201d a testament to her unyielding spirit and unmatched skill.Tomoe Gozen was a name that echoed through the annals of history, immortalized in the pages of the Tale of Heike, a chronicle of the Genpei War. She was renowned not just for her beauty\u2014described as having white skin, long hair, and pleasant features\u2014but for her unparalleled prowess in archery and swordsmanship. Her skills were legendary: an archer so powerful she could fell her enemies from great distances, and a swordswoman whose combat abilities were said to be worth a thousand men, capable of facing demons and deities alike, whether mounted or on foot.In the fierce battles of the Genpei War, Tomoe Gozen served as the first commander to Minamoto no Yoshinaka. Her valor and leadership were unmatched, inspiring fear and respect in equal measure. Yet, the chronicles remain silent on her fate after Yoshinaka's defeat in 1184, leaving her legacy shrouded in mystery.\nA world of uncertainty and constant conflict, another figure emerged\u2014a ronin named Sasaki Akimitsu. Unlike Tomoe Gozen, Akimitsu was a man driven by an inner turmoil, always ready to engage in a duel at a moment's notice. His reputation as a fearsome warrior was well-earned, but it came at a cost.Akimitsu's sister, Aoi, often worried about him. She watched over him with a heart full of concern, knowing his quick temper and solitary nature made him a target in the bustling towns he frequented. While Akimitsu sought solace in the chaos of the towns, Aoi knew that his loneliness was a wound that never healed. She feared for his safety, hoping that one day he would find peace.\nIt was in one such bustling towne and cities that the paths of Tomoe Gozen and Sasaki Akimitsu would eventually cross. Tomoe, always seeking the next challenge, and Akimitsu, with his relentless drive to prove himself, were on a collision course that neither could foresee.Their meeting would not be one of mere chance but of destiny, intertwined with the threads of fate that bound all ronins together. The sword named Unmei, a relic of great power and mystery, would play a crucial role in their story, guiding them toward a future neither could predict.As the shadows of the past and the uncertainties of the future loomed over them, Tomoe Gozen and Sasaki Akimitsu would discover that their wills were not so different after all. In the end, their journey would be one of understanding, redemption, and the unbreakable bonds forged in the fires of battle.Thus begins the tale of Tomoe Gozen and Sasaki Akimitsu, two souls in the world of ronins, each seeking their path, each carrying their burdens, and each destined to leave a mark on history.","description_hash":2299600545415944008},{"title":"Rwby: The Gathering","fiction_id":"87086","link":"https:\/\/www.royalroad.com\/fiction\/87086\/rwby-the-gathering","tags":["Progression","Strategy","Martial Arts","Multiple Lead Characters","Action","Adventure","Fantasy","Supernatural","Mythos"],"lable":"Fan Fiction","following_count":0,"rating":0.0,"page_count":7,"view_count":52,"chapters_count":1,"last_update":1716505290,"description":"People from all over Remnant and other planes must unite and fight together to protect their homes from evils, be it the Creatures of Grimm or otherwise.","description_hash":-1154088155223983419},{"title":"Sierpentine","fiction_id":"87085","link":"https:\/\/www.royalroad.com\/fiction\/87085\/sierpentine","tags":["Portal Fantasy \/ Isekai","Sci-fi","Mystery","Reincarnation","Soft Sci-fi"],"lable":"Original","following_count":0,"rating":0.0,"page_count":10,"view_count":120,"chapters_count":3,"last_update":1717465772,"description":"A cruel topology of rebirth, relife, and redeath.","description_hash":8078743606961890779},{"title":"The \"Expedition Squad\"","fiction_id":"87084","link":"https:\/\/www.royalroad.com\/fiction\/87084\/the-expedition-squad","tags":["Adventure","Fantasy","Historical","Magic","Mythos"],"lable":"Original","following_count":0,"rating":0.0,"page_count":11,"view_count":103,"chapters_count":3,"last_update":1716753882,"description":"Florence and his allies are guided by a cryptic message from a Viking rune stone.
