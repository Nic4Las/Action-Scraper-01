She is known as the Black Nymph, she serve as a guardian of the natural world, protectors of specific regions, or companions to deities. They are often depicted as ethereal beings with a deep connection to nature and the elements and a creature of both beauty and dread. Cloaked in midnight hues, her wings shimmer with a subtle iridescence that mirrors the starry sky, making her almost invisible to the untrained eye.\nMaellyn Strom, the black nymph, possesses powers ancient and deep, drawing strength from the very roots of an ancient Rowan tree. She can communicate with the trees, command the creatures of the night, and manipulate shadows to cloak her movements. Despite her fearsome reputation, she is a protector at heart, fiercely guarding the boundary of life and death against those who dare to defy and cause such transgression upon it.\nYet, she is a paradox, for her heart carries the burden of centuries of solitude, making her both aloof and profoundly melancholic. The mystical and enchanted dwellers living at the forest's edge speak of her in hushed tones, mixing reverence with fear. To them, she is a phantom, a whisper of silk wings in the night, a glimpse of otherworldly grace that reminds them of the magic that still pulses beneath the surface of their and others world .\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Disclaimer \nThe contents of this novel stem from the author's creative imagination.\u00a0 While inspired by real elements, the details within have been creatively modified and all scenarios and characters described are purely fictional, and any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or to real events is purely coincidental.Additionally any inaccuracies in the portrayal of cultural or historical aspects are unintentional.","description_hash":-8535897023310476344},{"title":"The Halls of Gregar","fiction_id":"88135","link":"https:\/\/www.royalroad.com\/fiction\/88135\/the-halls-of-gregar","tags":["Male Lead","Action","Adventure","Fantasy","Supernatural","Low Fantasy"],"lable":"Original","following_count":0,"rating":0.0,"page_count":22,"view_count":202,"chapters_count":3,"last_update":1718412766,"description":"When college graduate Orer Janesh and his cousin Kena are sent to spend a summer with their grandmother in the rolling countryside of Gregar, Orer is set on getting through the boring months with little zeal.

Well, you can\u2019t, really. They\u2019re already dead. At least, here they are. You see, each wizard obtains their respective mastery from the means of which they died. Their essence is captured in a pendant that enables their weapons and abilities. This process is called \u2018The Dead Spell\u2019. It\u2019s simple, and so far it\u2019s been quite effective.\n\nIt all starts with Zahir, the Master of Miracle. He\u2019s your typical leader, tall, kind, brave. We trust him. We love him, all of us will. We appreciate how he doesn\u2019t play favourites. Or, at least hides who his favourites are very well. Even if he does have favourites, we trust him. The only thing I find weird about that man is we don\u2019t know how he died. It\u2019s like trying to hide where you went to school - we don\u2019t need to know but it\u2019s weird that he\u2019s never mentioned it. Perhaps he never did. But we trust him.\u00a0\n\nOne-by-one Zahir has been reviving our sorry butts when we die in what he calls \u2018the death of a fool.\u2019 Which I always found funny, since if we\u2019re so foolish then why bother reviving us? Nevertheless. We\u2019ve grown into a bit of a family. A family who\u2019s really tough on newcomers. Which leads into our next person, Wren. Master of Gust. But that\u2019s not all she\u2019ll be known for.\n\nThe goal, the hope, is to assemble a team that can and will protect people from dying in unnatural ways. Car crashes, workplace incidents - extremeness varies, but you get the idea. These aren\u2019t \u2018natural\u2019 ways to go. They\u2019re caused by some variable that people either don\u2019t anticipate, or just choose to ignore. Nonetheless, it\u2019s no \u2018natural causes\u2019. This team is known as \u201cThe Risen\u201d. We know we can\u2019t protect everyone. I know some of us here don't even try. But I know I do.

This monstrous world, 185,000 times the size of Imperial Earth, has always been shrouded in mystery and potential. Shielded by a mysterious energy barrier and natural atmospheric quirks, Giga stayed a well-kept secret until recent breakthroughs by human explorers.\nYears ago, a gang of space pirates stumbled upon Giga. Their attempts to breach its formidable energy barrier failed, but they discovered a temporary gap that allowed exploratory drones, called \"Pathfinders,\" to break through. These Pathfinders sent back data revealing Giga's breathable atmosphere, stable climate, and abundance of unique minerals, flora, and wildlife. Massive trees with glowing leaves lit up the night, and rivers rich in unknown minerals flowed through lush valleys. Exotic creatures roamed freely.\nThe sale of this information triggered a wild era of exploration, like a cosmic gold rush. Settlers, mercenaries, and corporations scrambled to stake their claim on the untamed new world. Amid this turmoil, ancient Qilarian ruins surfaced, revealing relics of immense power and wisdom.\u00a0\nIn the uncharted expanses of Gigaterra, humanity entered a new era of colonization, driven by extraordinary advancements in bioengineering and cybernetics. The Federation and Mars spearheaded these innovations, creating hybrids like the nimble nekomimi and robust reptilians, while seamlessly integrating cybernetic implants to enhance physical and cognitive abilities. These breakthroughs paved the way for humanity to explore and settle new frontiers, transforming the fabric of human existence.\nThe Corporate Sector, with its affluence and technological prowess, dominated the landscape. Sky-High edifices and cutting-edge facilities showcased their influence, while the Settler Sector, with its improvised habitats and struggling populace, lagged far behind. This disparity created a \u00a0distinct devide between the high-tech environments of the elite and the dirty, graffiti-covered lower levels where settlers fought for survival.\nIn this era, bioengineered hybrids and cybernetically augmented individuals became commonplace among those who could afford them. On planets like Haven, where the lines between humanity and technology blurred, extreme modifications became a mark of status and power. At the heart of this transformative period stood the Explorer Committee, led by the formidable Zhen Wu Long. Operating independently but under the oversight of the governing Council, the Committee spearheaded the exploration and colonization of Gigaterra Prime. Their mission attracted support from the Federation, Mars, and major corporations, uniting them in a relentless pursuit of discovery and expansion.\nThis MOD Era allowed humans to become anything they desired, combining biological and cybernetic enhancements.\u00a0\nZhen Wu Long, a seasoned mercenary with a knack for leadership, saw the need for order. Under his guidance, the newly formed Explorer Committee stepped in to regulate the chaos, ensuring fair access to Giga's resources. The Committee aimed to harness the planet's potential while maintaining peace between organizations, guiding humanity's expansion into this new frontier.\nTihan Omnach, a thirty-year-old citizen of Haven from the first settlers wave and low-level corporate worker who had resigned to start a new life as a VR player. One day, while idly scrolling through news feeds, he stumbled upon an announcement about the Explorer Committee\u2019s establishment and recruitment.\nThis New Explorer Era on Gigaterra marks a defining chapter inhuman history.\nHis heart raced as he read the details. Here was a real chance for change, a tangible escape from the digital confines of his four walls and money problems.
