So much for that plan.\nNow, years later, he is dedicated to Lord Vennir, Patron Power of Wit, as a Dusk Knight, champion of all who call on his lord for aid, which mostly involves dealing with counterfeiting, contract disputes, embezzling, goods retrieval, death threats, and the occasional high risk repossession. Vennir is also the Patron of merchants, playwrights, comedians, and really clever thieves, after all.\nTo make matters worse, he didn't even manage to steer his class into something awesome like mage or warrior. No, far from it. Who's going to be afraid of a dancer?\nAnd now they've assigned him a Frigidi as a partner, a woman from the race of demons famous the world over for how uptight they are. He can\u2019t even figure out what name to call her.\nAt least the bard might make things fun.\n\nWhat to expect:\u00a0\nThis story is a shot from the hip into a fantasy-flavored LitRPG world that I\u2019ve been working on for two or three years now. This isn\u2019t the first thing I\u2019ve written in this world, but it\u2019s the first thing I\u2019m releasing, and it\u2019s coming in live. I have a decent idea where it\u2019s going, but I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019m getting there, which matches pretty well with Razavan and his approach to life. Update schedule is whenever I can, as this story is fighting with paying bills, children, and sanity for my attention.\nTakara, the City of Cats, is a vast trade city populated with cat folk and a whole ton of other races. It exists as a fairly stable early-industrial economy with a mix of tech and magitech powering things. The world of Agona where Takara is located is fundamentally governed by science with the System overlaid on top of it. Magic enhances or alters reality in predictable ways, but does not supplant it. There ARE numbers and pretty complex character sheets, but they will not be popping up often.\nThe writing style is character focused, primarily focused on Razavan, who is a character. The plot isn\u2019t going to be as important as the people, though sometimes important events will take hold. The main goal is fun, with the primary means for achieving that being to throw Razavan into situations he\u2019d rather not be in.\nThere will be romance. Razavan doesn\u2019t get a vote in this. There are harems as an element in some cultures, treated realistically. Razavan has no interest in them, and doesn\u2019t get one. Razavan\u2019s primary focus in life will be on surviving his job, however, so don\u2019t worry. There will be plenty of bloody excitement.\u00a0\nRazavan is not OP. He WILL get stronger, but Agona is a @(#&$ world where leveling is hard. Expect him to solve problems like a Paladin of the God of Wit should: by out-thinking, out-dodging, and out-talking them.\nOkay. Time for warnings.\nMay contain: Any of the horrible things that are conceivably possible in life. I aim for PG-13 on the visualization level, generally with fade to black on sexual things (NO graphic sex), and possibly R-rated gore if a scene needs to get serious. Takara is not a nice place, and it\u2019s fairly polite as far as all of Agona goes. I write dark things because I like to put them next to extremely light things. Heroic things. Think nobledark.\u00a0\nThat said, I\u2019m pretty sure the MC I\u2019ve picked is going to keep things fairly lighthearted.\u00a0\u00a0\nSoli Deo gloria.","description_hash":8978489201541639550},{"title":"Aged to Perfection [Cyberpunk Heist]","fiction_id":"88114","link":"https:\/\/www.royalroad.com\/fiction\/88114\/aged-to-perfection-cyberpunk-heist","tags":["Urban Fantasy","Anti-Hero Lead","Multiple Lead Characters","Sci-fi","Action","Fantasy","Short Story","Cyberpunk","Female Lead","Low Fantasy","Soft Sci-fi"],"lable":"Original","following_count":4,"rating":5.0,"page_count":11,"view_count":72,"chapters_count":1,"last_update":1717886196,"description":"Once a legendary mercenary, now a relic, Maria is drawn back into the underworld she thought she\u2019d left behind.\u00a0 [Participant in the Royal Road Community Magazine Contest - June 2024]","description_hash":-5475143678396504576},{"title":"Total War: Shogun in another world ","fiction_id":"88113","link":"https:\/\/www.royalroad.com\/fiction\/88113\/total-war-shogun-in-another-world","tags":["War and Military","Grimdark","Psychological","Multiple Lead Characters","Harem","Action","Drama","Fantasy","Male Lead","Strategy","High Fantasy","Ruling Class","Artificial Intelligence"],"lable":"Fan Fiction","following_count":4,"rating":0.0,"page_count":38,"view_count":315,"chapters_count":4,"last_update":1718607750,"description":"This story is about a guy who gets kill on earth.

Respected and feared by all who encounter them, a Bounty Hunter is a mercenary with a hint of an assassin thrown in for good measure when the job calls for it. Bounty Hunters deal in people, but not just any people. As their name suggests, they are only interested in those who have a bounty on their head. People need them, but also fear them. The cold-blooded nature of their profession can inspire fear because they have no moral code and only serve the bounty. A bounty hunter is rarely a welcome guest, and contact with members of this profession is almost always limited to business. There is no standard of training required, and their only oath is to deliver the bounty. But in the lands of Beseria, they are also the only source of justice some people can get against their more dangerous enemies. They are also the only organization in the lands that maintains a neutral stance and is afforded some protection from foreign armies, mercenaries, and the remnants of the Beserian army. This is because Bounty Hunters will work for anyone, and to destroy a bureau of theirs is to risk the wrath of a motley assortment of murderous hobos and professional assassins.Taken from his world for reasons unknown, bounty hunter Jaeger is left adrift in a world almost entirely different from his own. With the introduction of mystical people, magical abilities and monsters, he feels out of his depth. But one thing doesn't change: people still need his services, because no matter where you are or what magical means you have at your disposal, a bounty hunter is always needed.Releases every two weeks on Friday.","description_hash":493611369248489554},{"title":"Noblesse Oblige","fiction_id":"87678","link":"https:\/\/www.royalroad.com\/fiction\/87678\/noblesse-oblige","tags":["LitRPG","Progression","Strategy","Action","Adventure","Fantasy","Magic","GameLit","High Fantasy"],"lable":"Original","following_count":1,"rating":0.0,"page_count":10,"view_count":77,"chapters_count":1,"last_update":1717370431,"description":"This story follows the child of a noble family in a fantasy world with LitRPG\/GameLit elements.

Regardless of their many differences, they all share in one thing: the constant struggle against the dark tides that push at their borders.\u00a0\nOnly the hollows, a magicless race, live scattered against the shadows that shroud much of the land.

Different characters will follow differernt routes to power.\u00a0\n*Character-driven story: while there are occasional sporadic events, for the most part, the plot is advanced by the characters and their actions. Each will have their own motivations that (I hope) make sense. This includes the overarching antagonist(s).\u00a0\n*Different POVs: there will be different \u201cPOVs.\u201d In quotations because the story is written in third person.
