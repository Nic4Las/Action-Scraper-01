What to expect:
You can think of 'The System Awakens' as a cultivation novel similar to I Eat Tomatoes' novels with a system like 'The Primal Hunter' and 'Defiance of the Fall.'
In this novel, I try to blend my two favorite genres, which are Xianxia and LitRPG.
Lastly, I try to make my characters as realistic as possible. Most novels in this kind of genre have characters and MCs that are either sociopaths or have very loose morality straight out the gate and have no emotions when killing people. I want my MC to be like what I expect most people would be if they were thrown into this scenario. He will hate killing people. He and most others will struggle with it and try to push it off as much as they can until it's too late, and it either causes their deaths or they finally come to terms with their new reality.

A modern urban fantasy buddy cop detective story. The humor is generally dark comedic elements mixed with slap-sticky dialogue. Think Monty Python, Terry Pratchett, and the Cornetto triology, with a dash of Key and Peele thrown in. 
Content warnings: death is generally treated light-heartedly here, as part of the comedy is about people not dying, but there are attempts at suicide and the aftermath sketched out in vague terms. There is also discussion about the ethics of suicide, murder, and euthanasia when it is known that there is no risk of death. Some of the characters are entertained by performing acts that would normally be considered suicide. I consider attempted suicide self-harm, which is why I've marked the Sensitive Content tag.

She couldn't make herself sit for her exams. She couldn't manage to date cute girls. She could barely force herself to dress like a functional human being most mornings. And she was completely unprepared to deal with the un-diagnosed personality disorders that she wasn’t even sure she had.
If Simkha wanted to choke down the rest of her education, then she needed to figure out why she couldn’t do the same things everybody else could. What was this feeling in her stomach? She had no way to know. Surely, she could fix her life if she could just find an objective way to measure her wants, needs, and abilities. 
This story is a light sci-fi mental-health progression fantasy. Its genre elements kick off when Simkha dissociates so hard that she cracks the cosmos and falls out of the break. It will address questions like:
- Why is my body angry at me?
- Is time travel possible?
- Why can't I concentrate when I study?
- Is self-care easier with the help of alien super-technology?
- Am I worthy of love?
- What if our whole universe is Flatland?
- Why was I misdiagnosed with schizophrenia as a child?
- Can I ascend to a higher plane of existence?
- Is it okay to be autistic?
- Is it a good idea to let children play god without supervision?
- Should I blame all my problems on my best friend?

Or they would, had it not been for the small fact that the entirety of the universe is destroyed shortly after making contact with them, something which most people would refer to as a slight dilemma.
Rowan, or Rory for short, finds himself in the strange conundrum of not being dead post-deletion. In fact, he is in the lobby of his childhood doctor's office, having a pleasant conversation with an alien professor about why exactly they aren't dead.
Not at least a little confused, things are only made more strange when Rory wakes up to find himself in an alien world, the only living thing aside from plant life for as far as he can see. As if that isn't odd enough, he soon discovers this new universe works by decidedly different rules.
Almost completely alone, Rory must survive, if only because there isn't much to do but survive. His only sometimes-company is an odd World Spirit that seems insistent on his continued survival and growth, a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship that feels at least a little bit like a pyramid scheme.

Fifty years ago, the world fell into disarray. Monstrosities emerged among living beings. Hordes of savage beasts bearing faint resemblances to previously known creatures appeared, each with a brutality to match their strength. Cities fell in instants. Three-quarters of humanity was wiped out.
However, the beasts were not the only ones affected. From among the humans arose those referred to as Abnormals. They commanded abilities thought impossible, from the bizarre to the extraordinary.
The Legion, assembled by the World Government, fought hard and long - still do, even to this day - reclaiming lost territory and rejuvenating humanity.
Meanwhile, uncontrollable and dangerous Abnormals are placed in Camps, where they fight bloody battles daily, yet face disdain and disgrace.
And now, the World Government has summoned five thousand of the strongest Campers to Spire Island, home to the strongest forces of both humanity and beasts.

The entire story describes how they face and overcome a series of challenges together, including traveling through dense forests, crossing dangerous mountains, communicating with dragons, and crossing vast deserts.

Author's Note: 
Hi, I am really just here to share this imaginative world that I had been constantly thinking about. Years gone past where I slowly but surely built up this world detail by detail. I know I'm not the best, at perhaps character development or world building, or even at English at all. Nevertheless, I would like to share this world to the people who read this. If nobody reads this, so be it, but if it can even reach someone and entertain them for that little bit, I am satisfied. If you can afford the time to write reviews, it would be very much appreciated as I too, hope to improve as a story teller. Thank You.",961159716902805249

Sometimes you're up, but for me, it felt like I was mostly down.
 
Born in a cramped, leaky apartment, my family's struggle was like a heavy shadow, always there.
 
Despite their hard work, we could barely make ends meet.
 
I thought education would be my way out, so I buried myself in books, hoping hard work would change my fate.
 
But even that dream crumbled when I didn't get the scholarship, losing it to someone with a fancy last name but mediocre grades.
 
The unfairness stung deep.
 
I tried college, working jobs left and right to afford it, but eventually, I had to drop out.
 
My path led me to a karaoke bar where I started as a receptionist and worked my way up to General Manager. It was a hard climb, but I did it, thinking I could finally make a difference for my family.
 
But life had other plans.
 
One evening, walking home, my phone pinged with an update for ""A Magician’s Path,"" a webnovel I followed.
 
It was a welcome escape from my reality, set in a world where magic and tech blended, where your magic power decided your worth.
 
I envied the main character, born with wealth and magic, everything I wasn't.
 
As I lost myself in these thoughts, a car came out of nowhere. The crash, the pain, then darkness.
 
I thought it was the end…
 
But it wasn't.
 
I woke up in a world far from my dim apartment, a place straight out of the Webnovel, greeted by a holographic screen detailing my new life: Dominic Eñerforte, 15, with stats like strength, endurance, agility, and, unsurprisingly, zero mana.
 
But here's the twist - I had off-the-charts luck and instinct.
 
""Oh no.""

Somehow, I'd been transported into ""A Magician's Path,"" into Sylvestria, a world where magic meant everything, and I had none of it.
 
Knowing the story might be my only edge.
 
Magic or not, I had to get stronger. For someone born without a silver spoon, let alone magic, I knew life here would be tough.

Here, in the land of Aischala— home to humans, demi-humans and many diverse creatures and races, long ago, the most fantastical adventurers whose hearts were pure, that burned with passion and true desire to seek out the world, were deemed honorable enough to bear the title of 'Traveler'.
""Nowadays, the word 'Traveler' is merely a commonplace term to describe any given person who moves from place to place throughout the land.""
""Honestly, nothing special huh?""
As modern advancements ushered in a new age of technology and innovation, with it came mistrust and greed, as the introduction of new technology would revolutionize not just modern living, but the capability of combat itself.
War soon followed between the Royal Capital of Saint-Grandis who housed impressive technology. They found themselves locked in a brutal struggle for supremacy of the land against a territory of criminals and thieves– the most heinous of indiscriminate races who were banished from society for their despicable acts against civilization, to the barren red-sand dunes of the South, bringing peace for the common good of Aischala.
Thus, the land of Aischala was brought from a time of peace back into a dark age once more, which led to poverty, strife, and left many families broken.
""Many children were left without families– many were left behind, orphaned as a result.""
""Including myself.""
""When I was around Seven years old, within the various books and scattered titles in my adoptive father’s library, I discovered my own yearning and desire to learn about the fantastical mysteries contained within each vivid page.""
""Despite my passion and naivety, could I be the one to stand at the very ends of the world, to inherit the true meaning of what being a 'Traveler' is all about?""
""Would I be able to withstand what this journey holds in store for me?""
""Or am I just way in over my head?""
""Seek the answers together with me.""
""This is my journey, my story...""

This was so unreal. Fire burns brightly in the centre of the city as I run through the crowds of the undead, gasping for air as I feel my feet nearly give out before hearing it -
Gun shots.
And I knew then that I wasn't the only one who hadn't turned. Not yet.

Dear Readers,
Welcome to this adventure. I hope you'll enjoy it.
A forewarning about what to expect: This book contains many triggering tropes from a darker era. Violence, foul language, and stereotypes are present. These do not reflect my views but aim to provide insight into the period. Many things you read here, though lightly represented, were true.
This book is not fan fiction. The allusion to the Ninja Turtles is just a nod.
It is a mild Lit RPG with an original System.
There are twists in the storyline.
It features a strong-to-stronger main character.
Albeit the action begins slowly and grows to be more intense after chapter 8, this is NOT a slow burn and will not have 10k+ chapters. The first volume has about 80k words and 40 chapters, which I'll release two or three times a week. The action moves quickly but logically, with interludes to make it clear.
Good feedback is appreciated and will be considered for a second edition, and Kindle. There will be no major editing while I post this first version; it's a busy time in RL.
I'm not a native English speaker, so please keep this in mind.
Thank you.",-1959391203760833791

It was the third kind that Helena couldn't handle. Laws that only she was expected to uphold:
Stare at exactly two centimeters above a person's eyes to avoid looking directly into them, always smile so as to never appear intimidating, talk in a low voice so that people could not hear your opinion, and try your best to not stick out - something near impossible at 6 feet 3 inches. 
As difficult as all those rules were, she excelled at following every last one. At least until she took a bad tumble near the orphanage one morning and every ounce of politeness got knocked right out of her.

Earth, now a nature preserve, holds a forgotten secret - a dormant rune portal, whispered about in ancient texts.
One day, a surge of magic rips across the fabric of reality, emanating from the depths of Earth. Across the vast emptiness of space, sensors pick up a faint anomaly near the blue marble. Intrigued, a team of xeno-archaeologists embarks on a forbidden mission to Earth. 
On the other side, a desperate act of defiance unfolds. Atheria, a once vibrant world, teeters on the brink of annihilation.

Instead, she opens a portal to a world unrecognizable - a world of metal behemoths floating in the sky, lush jungles untouched.

For centuries, it flourished as a cultural, scientific, and commercial center of great wealth under the rule of the Kingdom of Lebias.
However, the kingdom eventually fell into chaos and decadence, harassed by the emerging empires of the eastern continent of Ayaria. Desperate, it begged for help from the friendly kingdoms of the western continent, Elvira, as a last resort to prevent the imminent advance of corruption and barbarism.
Thus, the bloody ""nefeshic wars"" erupted, in which both civilizations clashed in fierce battles with a display of weapons, tactics, and powers where the old myths and legends of their sacred texts came back to life.
Several years after its end, a self-proclaimed wandering knight travels to the ancestral lands, following the trail of his mysterious origins. Under the motto ""My wandering sword for thy Lordship's safety,"" he will try to set an example of honor and justice, the same example that he has been responsible for bringing to all the domains he has explored in the past.
Unfortunately, his good intentions will be hindered by a series of serious misunderstandings that will drag him into a new struggle between supernatural forces. A new nefeshic war that will determine not only the fate of Najta, but of the entire world of Mater.",-4316354865052039082

Confusion, despair, fear, and panic were evident in her gaze as she struggled to maintain eye contact. It only took 6 seconds for her eyes to start to dull, adopting a doll-like, glassy shine. Yet, even as her life ebbed away, her chest spasmed and heaved, as if breathing would somehow provide more oxygen to her suffocating brain.

The depression is going full force in 1937 Wynne, Arkansas, but while the Bentwood family has it easier than most, 17 year-old Marshall wants out. The only thing in his life he loves, other than his family, is The Ridge, a beautiful low mountain range near his home. Regardless, he’s sick of farming, sick of mules, sick of plowing, sick of his life and is determined to leave and see the world.
He gets his wish, but at a deadly price. After crossing two bootleggers to aid a friend, Marshall is target by these men to be an example. But, by mistake they beat his 18 year-old look-a-like brother, James, to death.
Knowing the courts are owned by the county’s moon shiners and that, at best, they will get just a “slap on the wrist” Marshall, one of the best hunters and shots in the county, decides to meet out justice to fit the crime, killing the two men from ambush.
When he’s finished, he knows he’s done what is right, but he also knows that further retribution will ensue if he remains in the area. So he leaves home setting out across the southwest by rail and by thumb never expecting to return home and hoping the matter will end there.
Along the way he meets a cast of characters, both real and fictional, which only a worldwide depression could create. Destitute families, traveling minstrels and railroad “bulls”, among others, cross his path. He also comes face-to-face with massive human loss in the form of an actual Texas school disaster which is still the greatest of it’s kind. All of these things come together to test the boy’s fortitude, honesty, faith and sense of right and wrong.
But even though Marshall leaves, not satisfied to just let the matter drop, the vicious father and two ruthless sisters of one of the bootleggers kidnap Marshall’s six year-old sister. Knowing she will be killed if Marshall isn’t found and returned, a four-state hunt for the teen hunt ensues.
Once found, the race is on to get Marshall back to Wynne before the kidnapper’s deadline. What follows is a deadly meeting in the snowy woods of the Arkansas countryside and The Ridge which finally brings this bloody family feud to a stunning conclusion.
 The story of Marshall Bentwood, is a story of courage and family loyalty set against the depression and the rumblings of a coming world war. In The Ridge: Justice Unbound, the reader sees the type of character, Tom Brokaw called, the Greatest Generation.",2359734105784836747

She is known as the Black Nymph, she serve as a guardian of the natural world, protectors of specific regions, or companions to deities. They are often depicted as ethereal beings with a deep connection to nature and the elements and a creature of both beauty and dread. Cloaked in midnight hues, her wings shimmer with a subtle iridescence that mirrors the starry sky, making her almost invisible to the untrained eye.
Maellyn Strom, the black nymph, possesses powers ancient and deep, drawing strength from the very roots of an ancient Rowan tree. She can communicate with the trees, command the creatures of the night, and manipulate shadows to cloak her movements. Despite her fearsome reputation, she is a protector at heart, fiercely guarding the boundary of life and death against those who dare to defy and cause such transgression upon it.
Yet, she is a paradox, for her heart carries the burden of centuries of solitude, making her both aloof and profoundly melancholic. The mystical and enchanted dwellers living at the forest's edge speak of her in hushed tones, mixing reverence with fear. To them, she is a phantom, a whisper of silk wings in the night, a glimpse of otherworldly grace that reminds them of the magic that still pulses beneath the surface of their and others world .

In a world teeming with magic and ancient prophecies, a prodigious girl is born with a destiny she cannot escape.
Nyx has always known she was different. Born under the twin moons of Eclipsarum and blessed with unparalleled magical abilities, she is the chosen one destined to confront and defeat the malevolent demon king, Anos. From a young age, Nyx is trained rigorously in combat and sorcery, honing her skills for the day she will face her greatest challenge.
The kingdom of Eclipsarum, a land of breathtaking beauty and hidden dangers, teeters on the brink of destruction. The shadow of Anos's reign spreads, leaving fear and chaos in its wake. His dark powers grow stronger, and with each passing day, the hope of the people wanes. They look to Nyx as their beacon of hope, their last line of defense against the encroaching darkness.
Nyx's journey is fraught with peril. Alongside a diverse group of allies—a stoic knight, a cunning rogue, and a wise sorceress—she ventures through enchanted forests, over treacherous mountains, and into the heart of Anos's dark domain. Each step forward reveals more about her own powers and the true extent of the demon king's evil.
As Nyx faces trials that test her strength and resolve, she learns that her destiny is not just to wield power but to understand its cost. Her battles against Anos's minions are not only physical but also moral, challenging her to question the very nature of good and evil. In moments of quiet reflection and intense conflict, she begins to see that her purpose might be more complex than simply defeating an enemy.
In a climactic showdown, Nyc confronts Anos in his fortress of shadows. The battle is fierce, pushing her to the limits of her abilities.
""The End of Destiny"" is a riveting tale of courage, sacrifice, and the power of choice. In a world where magic shapes destinies, Nyx’s journey teaches us that true strength lies not just in fulfilling one's fate, but in forging a new path when the old one no longer serves. Through her struggles and triumphs, readers will be captivated by a story that explores the depths of human spirit and the transformative power of understanding and empathy.",-5160354604558200870

Klik is a goblin, and he hates it
Klik spends more time with Elder Zelena than he does with his own tribe. Unlike them, she cares for him, talks to him as an equal, treats him with kindness. In her little home, he feels safe, not in constant fear of his siblings pouncing on him at any moment. There’s only one problem though: She doesn’t know he’s a goblin.
Every time he visits Zelena, he wears a wooden mask and a cloak that covers up his head and body. If she knew he was a goblin, everything would be over. Without his mask and cloak, the town would see him for what he truly is: a monster. Klik wants to be normal. And normal means ‘human’, doesn’t it?
To Jelnar Lariel, none of that matters though, because he’s set on an indiscriminate goblin hunt. Prophecies foretell of a powerful magic relic, hidden in the depths of the Velhana jungle, possessed by a tribe of goblins. What Jelnar wants is not normalcy, but supremacy. And the Eye of Zokurath is his path to power, even if he has to massacre goblins in his wake.
As Klik watches humans kill the goblins of his tribe, he wonder what it means to be a monster. Is a monster born, or created?",-4971616513907770193

As the specter of war looms ever closer, Claudia's resolve is tested when her father falls gravely ill amidst the encroaching shadows of famine and banditry.
Driven by a desire to alleviate her family's suffering and carve out her own destiny, Claudia takes a bold step into the unknown, joining the ranks of the legion. But her journey takes an unexpected turn when she finds herself thrust into a realm shrouded in mystery and peril alongside the XI Legion.
As Claudia and her comrades navigate this strange new world, they encounter towering titans and eerie remnants of a forgotten age, bearing witness to a landscape scarred by ancient conflicts and primordial chaos. Amidst the chaos, questions linger: How will the women of the XI Legion shape the destiny of this realm? Will cooperation triumph over conflict, or will the clash of civilizations spell doom for both worlds?
With the fate of two realms hanging in the balance, Claudia must confront her own doubts and fears as she grapples with the uncertainty of what lies ahead.

Oh well. So much for that plan.
Now, years later, he is dedicated to Lord Vennir, Patron Power of Wit, as a Dusk Knight, champion of all who call on his lord for aid, which mostly involves dealing with counterfeiting, contract disputes, embezzling, goods retrieval, death threats, and the occasional high risk repossession. Vennir is also the Patron of merchants, playwrights, comedians, and really clever thieves, after all.
To make matters worse, he didn't even manage to steer his class into something awesome like mage or warrior. No, far from it. Who's going to be afraid of a dancer?
And now they've assigned him a Frigidi as a partner, a woman from the race of demons famous the world over for how uptight they are. He can’t even figure out what name to call her.
At least the bard might make things fun.

What to expect: 
This story is a shot from the hip into a fantasy-flavored LitRPG world that I’ve been working on for two or three years now. This isn’t the first thing I’ve written in this world, but it’s the first thing I’m releasing, and it’s coming in live. I have a decent idea where it’s going, but I’m not sure how I’m getting there, which matches pretty well with Razavan and his approach to life. Update schedule is whenever I can, as this story is fighting with paying bills, children, and sanity for my attention.
Takara, the City of Cats, is a vast trade city populated with cat folk and a whole ton of other races. It exists as a fairly stable early-industrial economy with a mix of tech and magitech powering things. The world of Agona where Takara is located is fundamentally governed by science with the System overlaid on top of it. Magic enhances or alters reality in predictable ways, but does not supplant it. There ARE numbers and pretty complex character sheets, but they will not be popping up often.
The writing style is character focused, primarily focused on Razavan, who is a character. The plot isn’t going to be as important as the people, though sometimes important events will take hold. The main goal is fun, with the primary means for achieving that being to throw Razavan into situations he’d rather not be in.
There will be romance. Razavan doesn’t get a vote in this. There are harems as an element in some cultures, treated realistically. Razavan has no interest in them, and doesn’t get one. Razavan’s primary focus in life will be on surviving his job, however, so don’t worry. There will be plenty of bloody excitement. 
Razavan is not OP. He WILL get stronger, but Agona is a @(#&$ world where leveling is hard. Expect him to solve problems like a Paladin of the God of Wit should: by out-thinking, out-dodging, and out-talking them.
Okay. Time for warnings.
May contain: Any of the horrible things that are conceivably possible in life. I aim for PG-13 on the visualization level, generally with fade to black on sexual things (NO graphic sex), and possibly R-rated gore if a scene needs to get serious. Takara is not a nice place, and it’s fairly polite as far as all of Agona goes. I write dark things because I like to put them next to extremely light things. Heroic things. Think nobledark. 
That said, I’m pretty sure the MC I’ve picked is going to keep things fairly lighthearted.

You see—funnily enough for an exorcist family—Wynn has grown to be the host of a malicious, prankish evil spirit that they call the Goblin.

Wynn’s Goblin side is always trying to get the best of his grandma on a daily, while Nola has to draw out the spirit and exorcise it. And this simply gives her more time to bond with her dear relative!

Set in the verdant heart of Tennessee, Jonas's life takes a dramatic turn when he acquires a dilapidated Victorian mansion with plans to revive its former splendor. But as he delves into the restoration, he peels back layers of decay to reveal a hidden dungeon in the walls—a chilling testament to the mansion’s murky and mysterious past.
The discovery launches Jonas into an unexpected adventure as the dungeon unveils secrets dark enough to disrupt the peace of the small town and powerful enough to reshape Jonas's perspective on his own history. Each room and artifact whispers of long-ago triumphs, tragedies, and betrayals, pulling Jonas deeper into a labyrinth of local legend and scandal.
As he explores the enigmatic dungeon, Jonas encounters an eclectic and fantastical group of monster girls. There's Tillu, the spirited Pixie-Gnome with a harrowing tale of escape from werewolves, and Boali, the majestic Dragon beauty who leads a covert tribe of her kin. Together with these enigmatic creatures, Jonas’s life becomes entwined with Christie and Kelly, two human women from the town who had already begun to capture his heart before the dungeon's discovery. The arrival of Cici, a mysterious figure with her own shadowed past and connections to the house’s secrets, adds another layer to the unfolding drama.
Together, these women form a diverse harem that not only offers Jonas companionship but also aids him in navigating the complexities of the mansion. As they unearth the intertwined histories of the place and their own lives, they form a bond that transcends the confines of time and circumstance, offering Jonas not just romantic entanglements but a profound sense of belonging and purpose.
Blending elements of mystery, history, fantasy, and romance, **The Dungeon in the Wall** is more than a thrilling adventure; it's a narrative about rediscovery and redemption. As Jonas and his companions confront the shadows of the past, they illuminate the power of love and hope in even the darkest places. This novel is a portal to a story where the echoes of the past meet the promise of the future, proving that within the walls of the seemingly ordinary, extraordinary tales await.

He'll have a power or to but nothing overpowered and that's it. Oh not to mention a large dog and a mule to carry more stuff. His first world will last a while, don't be surprised if he doesn't kick the bucket till quite late in life, we'll see though. I plan to take as long as I like on each world and this book won't have any schedule but that might change who knows. Don't expect anything though. Ciao.

This was planned to be a slow-burning dungeon crawler with multiple character point of views, action adventure monster slaughtering, and epic world-building. I think it's actually going to be a prequel story to something much larger, with only 15 chapters plus an epilogue.
I wrote the first three chapters in three days, and only then realized I'd put far too much detail into them for one web series. I can't possibly do this entire thing justice with just one storyline here in one book. That is why this will only be 15 chapters with a very clear beginning, middle, and end.


This was written for the Goblins and Grandma's Community Magazine Contest June 2024. This is my first story on RR, and no previous reading/lore is required. In fact, this is the beginning of a much larger story. It's a 3rd person point of view from all the different characters who get caught up in world changing events.
I'll post more information here at the end of June 2024, but basically I am creating 1st person narratives for the 3 different storylines here. People can read this one as a prequel, and then choose which character they most want to follow. I should also mention that I don't intend to make this one required reading. Each individual future narrative will be stand-alone.",3327549695933587630

However, shadows of ambition and betrayal loom as the rival Kingdom of Shujaa, led by the cunning Queen Adanna, covets Nzuri's fertile lands and resources. Her strategic maneuvers and whispered alliances sow discord within Nzuri's court.
King Abasi's three children, Prince Kofi, Princess Amara, and Prince Jengo, each face personal trials amidst the growing tensions. Prince Kofi, a noble warrior, Princess Amara, a beloved diplomat, and Prince Jengo, an adventurous spirit, all find their loyalty tested. Watching the unfolding drama is the enigmatic Order of the Baobab, a group of seers and shamans led by the blind shaman Asha, who foretell a prophecy of fire, blood, and a new order.
The brewing storm culminates when Queen Adanna invites King Abasi to a parley at the neutral Great Baobab Grove. Despite sensing treachery, Abasi, bound by honor, attends with Prince Kofi and loyal guards. Ambushed by hidden assassins, Abasi is mortally wounded, his last command to Kofi: ""Protect Nzuri... at all costs."" With a heavy heart, Kofi retreats, carrying his father's body back to their kingdom.
The news of the king's death sparks grief and rage in Nzuri. Princess Amara uses her diplomatic prowess to rally the people and nobles, while Prince Jengo's daring raids inspire courage. The Order of the Baobab reveals their prophecy to the royal siblings, speaking of the Heart of the Savannah, a legendary artifact that could tip the scales in their favor.
Embarking on a perilous quest, the siblings traverse treacherous landscapes, battle fierce creatures, and overcome ancient traps, forging unbreakable bonds and uncovering truths about their heritage. They finally grasp the radiant gem, the Heart of the Savannah, pulsing with primal energy.
Armed with the artifact, the siblings return to Nzuri, their resolve unshaken. The final battle against Shujaa is fierce, with the Heart of the Savannah turning the tide. In a climactic duel under the burning sun, Prince Kofi defeats Queen Adanna, avenging his father and securing Nzuri's future.

“How do you kill a wizard? Well, you can’t, really. They’re already dead. At least, here they are. You see, each wizard obtains their respective mastery from the means of which they died. Their essence is captured in a pendant that enables their weapons and abilities. This process is called ‘The Dead Spell’. It’s simple, and so far it’s been quite effective.

It all starts with Zahir, the Master of Miracle. He’s your typical leader, tall, kind, brave. We trust him. We love him, all of us will. We appreciate how he doesn’t play favourites. Or, at least hides who his favourites are very well. Even if he does have favourites, we trust him. The only thing I find weird about that man is we don’t know how he died. It’s like trying to hide where you went to school - we don’t need to know but it’s weird that he’s never mentioned it. Perhaps he never did. But we trust him. 

One-by-one Zahir has been reviving our sorry butts when we die in what he calls ‘the death of a fool.’ Which I always found funny, since if we’re so foolish then why bother reviving us? Nevertheless. We’ve grown into a bit of a family. A family who’s really tough on newcomers. Which leads into our next person, Wren. Master of Gust. But that’s not all she’ll be known for.

The goal, the hope, is to assemble a team that can and will protect people from dying in unnatural ways. Car crashes, workplace incidents - extremeness varies, but you get the idea. These aren’t ‘natural’ ways to go. They’re caused by some variable that people either don’t anticipate, or just choose to ignore. Nonetheless, it’s no ‘natural causes’. This team is known as “The Risen”. We know we can’t protect everyone. I know some of us here don't even try. But I know I do. Maybe that’s the problem…”",3149142184453640688

With the loss of his mother, crushed beneath the weight of the Towers' arrival, and the absence of his father, who vanished without a trace, Sebastian is left to fend for himself in a world turned upside down.
Forced into joining Varun Academy, a grim institution on the outskirts of civilization, Sebastian struggles to find his footing in a world that has left him behind. With no one to turn to and nowhere else to go, he reluctantly embarks on a journey of self-discovery and redemption, seeking solace in the only place he has left to call home.
As Sebastian grapples with the despair of his shattered world, he discovers a dark and forbidden power within himself—the ability to devour the life force of any living creature. With each life he consumes, Sebastian gains strength and power, his soul tarnished by the darkness that consumes him.
Leaving behind the safety of the academy, Sebastian ventures into the Towers, his heart heavy with the weight of his past and the uncertainty of his future. With each floor he conquers, he faces despair and agony, his soul torn asunder by the darkness that surrounds him.
But as Sebastian delves deeper into the depths of the Towers, he begins to unravel the mysteries of his past and unlock the true potential that lies dormant within him. With each victory he achieves, he grows stronger, more ruthless, and more determined to defy the odds and carve out his own destiny in a world consumed by darkness.
But as Sebastian's power grows, so too does the darkness that threatens to consume him. Haunted by visions of a future shrouded in despair, he must confront the ultimate truth—that the path to power comes with a price, and the line between saviour and destroyer grows ever thinner.",-4364364349690575508

In the vastness of space, nestled in the Andromeda galaxy, lies the colossal planet Gigaterra Prime, known as Giga or G-1. This monstrous world, 185,000 times the size of Imperial Earth, has always been shrouded in mystery and potential. Shielded by a mysterious energy barrier and natural atmospheric quirks, Giga stayed a well-kept secret until recent breakthroughs by human explorers.
Years ago, a gang of space pirates stumbled upon Giga. Their attempts to breach its formidable energy barrier failed, but they discovered a temporary gap that allowed exploratory drones, called ""Pathfinders,"" to break through. These Pathfinders sent back data revealing Giga's breathable atmosphere, stable climate, and abundance of unique minerals, flora, and wildlife. Massive trees with glowing leaves lit up the night, and rivers rich in unknown minerals flowed through lush valleys. Exotic creatures roamed freely.
The sale of this information triggered a wild era of exploration, like a cosmic gold rush. Settlers, mercenaries, and corporations scrambled to stake their claim on the untamed new world. Amid this turmoil, ancient Qilarian ruins surfaced, revealing relics of immense power and wisdom. 
In the uncharted expanses of Gigaterra, humanity entered a new era of colonization, driven by extraordinary advancements in bioengineering and cybernetics. The Federation and Mars spearheaded these innovations, creating hybrids like the nimble nekomimi and robust reptilians, while seamlessly integrating cybernetic implants to enhance physical and cognitive abilities. These breakthroughs paved the way for humanity to explore and settle new frontiers, transforming the fabric of human existence.
The Corporate Sector, with its affluence and technological prowess, dominated the landscape. Sky-High edifices and cutting-edge facilities showcased their influence, while the Settler Sector, with its improvised habitats and struggling populace, lagged far behind. This disparity created a  distinct devide between the high-tech environments of the elite and the dirty, graffiti-covered lower levels where settlers fought for survival.
In this era, bioengineered hybrids and cybernetically augmented individuals became commonplace among those who could afford them. On planets like Haven, where the lines between humanity and technology blurred, extreme modifications became a mark of status and power. At the heart of this transformative period stood the Explorer Committee, led by the formidable Zhen Wu Long. Operating independently but under the oversight of the governing Council, the Committee spearheaded the exploration and colonization of Gigaterra Prime. Their mission attracted support from the Federation, Mars, and major corporations, uniting them in a relentless pursuit of discovery and expansion.
This MOD Era allowed humans to become anything they desired, combining biological and cybernetic enhancements. 
Zhen Wu Long, a seasoned mercenary with a knack for leadership, saw the need for order. Under his guidance, the newly formed Explorer Committee stepped in to regulate the chaos, ensuring fair access to Giga's resources. The Committee aimed to harness the planet's potential while maintaining peace between organizations, guiding humanity's expansion into this new frontier.
Tihan Omnach, a thirty-year-old citizen of Haven from the first settlers wave and low-level corporate worker who had resigned to start a new life as a VR player. One day, while idly scrolling through news feeds, he stumbled upon an announcement about the Explorer Committee’s establishment and recruitment.
This New Explorer Era on Gigaterra marks a defining chapter inhuman history.
His heart raced as he read the details. Here was a real chance for change, a tangible escape from the digital confines of his four walls and money problems. Drawn by the promise of adventure and the chance to uncover the mysteries of Giga, Tihan seized the opportunity without hesitation.",-6608988153557953438

Once upon a time, in a fantasy land full of magic and dragons and unicorns and happiness, there was a girl. Everyone in the kingdom loved the girl unconditionally. Not only was she the most beautiful person in the world, but she was also the kindest soul one could ever have met. Born a princess with all the power, wealth, and happiness she could ever want, she lived her life beautifully. Handsome men from all over the country would come just to be her husband, and everyone would wish to serve her should they have the chance.
That wasn't me. That was the main character, Aphrodite, in an erotica I'd read. I was her annoying and hardly mentioned sister, Persephone, and this world was heading toward an apocalypse. And if I couldn't get out of this place before I was found to not be her, I would be executed. Great. Cool. I could do this!
... On the bright side, I was surrounded by hot guys, and one of my absolute favorite characters was willing to help me! Yes!

This is a story written out of pure rage. I had a lot of fun writing it. This began as a rage-written story, but it has 148k already written, and it's pretty much complete. Regardless, feel free to comment on how bad it is. I only wrote it to spite the manwha I'd been reading at the time.
I don't know what to call it or what genres it falls under, because it wasn't written satirically (though it should have been). It's a nothing-burger given form and plot. Just like the dumb manwha I'd been reading. But better. Because there's... Trauma?

For our newborn protagonist, everything in her life had been building towards a single purpose. To meet her long-awaited Hero. 

So, with the ‘script’ in her hands, she set out to do just that. She set out to reshape the whole world. She cast down the other Gods from their thrones, re-aligned the stars and twisted the strings of fate until they could be twisted no more.

And now, she has everything in place for the first scene in the script. A brief, fleeting moment in an obscure alleyway. There, she sees the moment when her Hero finally begins his journey to save the world. But then…

“Your purpose was to give him the first push, not trigger some last-stage demonic awakening.”

Things start to go awry. The people around her begin acting out-of-line. The ‘puppets’ around her are playing politics, the Demons and Angels are preparing for war and resentful Gods are still lurking in the shadows beyond her gaze. 

The world is slowly being set on fire as dozens of actors, from the lowliest of mortals to the highest of gods, begin forging their own destiny astray from her designs.

One by one, these godless strings are beginning to snap.

Almost a decade on, even their supposed purpose—to keep Baalphorian citizens prepared for another war—is becoming harder for even the raid’s most ardent supporters to justify.
After her friend is dosed with an illegal and highly dangerous drug, however, the raids that Emilia has hated since this inception are the least of her worries.

For almost a decade, Emilia has been running. Running from her past, from the person she once was, from the war and destruction that ripped her country, her soul, her very core apart.
She has a good life. She has friends and school and the normalcy that she always craved. She doesn’t miss her old life—not often, anyways. She’s locked her ability to miss away, along with so many of the skills that made her a so-called war hero.
Emilia always knew the normal, relaxing life she carved out for herself wouldn’t last. So, when a series of events bring old friends and scars back into her life, when the government sponsored raids start to get even more out of control than they already were, when secrets about the real reason behind the war start to echo out into the world, Emilia knows its just a matter of time before she has to stop running.

A salad full of cursed mushrooms returned her to the days of her youth. She was given a second chance at life, as well as a new opportunity to find out what's been bothering her grandson.

Another thing to mention is that English is not my native language, hence any grammar mistakes or bad sentence structure are to blame for that. Not that's an excuse though!

The core of the world is a crystal that burns with endless aetheric energy, which thus imbues the planet and everything on it with its power. From this power was born the dragons. Each dragon was given – by the primordial dragon, first dragon and guardian of magic – dominion over an element. fire, water, earth, air, metal, plant, light, dark, and beyond. Together, the dragons created the world. 
Once the world was made, the mortals took their home upon it. Unlike the dragons, mortals were not born with any connection to an element, but to the core itself. This allowed mortals the ability to cast, and what’s more, create magic. However, the great evil – jealous of the core – sent agents to destroy the world. Mortals fought back, valiantly.

Respected and feared by all who encounter them, a Bounty Hunter is a mercenary with a hint of an assassin thrown in for good measure when the job calls for it. Bounty Hunters deal in people, but not just any people. As their name suggests, they are only interested in those who have a bounty on their head. People need them, but also fear them. The cold-blooded nature of their profession can inspire fear because they have no moral code and only serve the bounty. A bounty hunter is rarely a welcome guest, and contact with members of this profession is almost always limited to business. There is no standard of training required, and their only oath is to deliver the bounty. But in the lands of Beseria, they are also the only source of justice some people can get against their more dangerous enemies. They are also the only organization in the lands that maintains a neutral stance and is afforded some protection from foreign armies, mercenaries, and the remnants of the Beserian army. This is because Bounty Hunters will work for anyone, and to destroy a bureau of theirs is to risk the wrath of a motley assortment of murderous hobos and professional assassins.Taken from his world for reasons unknown, bounty hunter Jaeger is left adrift in a world almost entirely different from his own. With the introduction of mystical people, magical abilities and monsters, he feels out of his depth. But one thing doesn't change: people still need his services, because no matter where you are or what magical means you have at your disposal, a bounty hunter is always needed.Releases every two weeks on Friday.",-6719934194469771455

Of course that would be all so useless if not for the fact that he manages to wake up, now finding himself as a newborn dragon of all things!

A new body, a new blend of instincts and thought, nature and nurture, a chaos that gets to decide who and what he will end up being.

What to expect: 
*Grimdark: while there will be moments of warmth and tenderness, the setting and tone will remain in line with what one should expect from a grimdark story. This is not an isekai or a LitRPG.
*Slow progression: characters growing stronger is both a plot point and a focus, but it will take time for them to grow comfortable with their individual powersets. Different characters will follow differernt routes to power. 
*Character-driven story: while there are occasional sporadic events, for the most part, the plot is advanced by the characters and their actions. Each will have their own motivations that (I hope) make sense. This includes the overarching antagonist(s). 
*Different POVs: there will be different “POVs.” In quotations because the story is written in third person. Many will return, but some will be once-offs. 
Lastly, please heed the violence and content warnings. There won’t be any outright murderhobos or murderhobo-ing (that’s a word, right?), but there will be violence, and some of it will be both gruesome and graphic. In the same vein, darker topics will be present, but never the focus.

Aiden finally gave in to the messages barraging his phone after letting out a grunt of annoyance. With a dazed look, he let his hand fumble around the nightstand, eventually holding his phone after a few tries and opened it to numerous messages on the group from his friends.

Eyes still half closed, he went through the messages, “Look at the night, the moon looks so red!” “The moon is beautiful today!” “The night sky is breathtaking, look outside your window!” “There’s no way you want to miss the moon today!” Due to his habit of sleeping in complete darkness, with curtains closed, he didn’t, on instinct, immediately turn around to look outside the window near his bed, which caused his gaze to linger around longer to find a letter on the nightstand.

Huh? I don’t remember placing anything else here?

When he held the letter though, a symbol embossed on it immediately caught his attention. It was of a secret society he made along with his friends when they were kids. Friends who had one by one disappeared from his life. He opened it to find only a single piece of paper, and some liquid dripping on his palm.

Quickly transitioning to a sitting posture while he grasped the paper in one hand, he turned on the lamp with the other. His eyes widened, pupils dilating, as he looked at the hand holding the paper, which soon began shaking as dark red liquid kept sliding off the paper to stain his hand. 

Is it blood?

Containing his fear, he concentrated his gaze onto the paper which had some messy words written over it with the same liquid.

Don’t look at the moon!

The Great Smog brought countless incomprehensible disasters. Turns out it wasn’t unity that worked, but fragmentation. The government relocated people from cities to towns across the lands, thinning out the population. It worked, the number of disasters witnessed a drastic decline, making it manageable for the government to deal with.

Years after The Great Smog, Aiden Spencer has come across such incomprehensible disasters, one even in his home.

With his quick wit and resourcefulness, he sets out to create a new life for himself, determined to thrive in a world gone mad.

Moving to Monterey Bay for college was supposed to be my big adventure, you know, fresh start, new dreams, that sort of thing. But instead of worrying about my first day jitters, I found myself in a real-life nightmare – trapped in a chilling ritual chamber, surrounded by the echoes of cries and the stench of blood and old earth. It was like stepping into the worst horror game, except the iron collar around my neck and the creepy messages flooding my vision were all too real.Thrown into this bizarre, terrifying world, I had to pinch myself to believe it. Monsters, magic, chaos – it felt like a messed-up dream. But hey, a girl's got to do what a girl's got to do, right? My will to survive kicked in big time. I wasn't going to let the darkness, or the monsters, swallow me up.It was like being lost in a twisted version of a history book – ruined cities, ancient secrets, and here I was, running from demons and dodging danger at every turn. I didn’t even recognize myself anymore, thrust into this strange role, armed with just a smidge of newfound magic. But I learned something out there – when life throws you into the deep end, you either sink or learn to swim real fast.
And trust is a funny thing in a world where everyone's a stranger. I had to rely on others, not knowing if they were friend or foe. But amidst all the fear and uncertainty, I found little sparks of hope and friendship. I knew I had to find out why this happened to me, to chase even the faintest chance of getting back home – a home that was starting to feel like a distant dream.So, with a deep breath (and maybe a little pep talk), I stepped forward on this wild, scary, but kind of exhilarating path. I was determined to unravel the mystery of my abduction and hold onto the hope of returning to a life that, once upon a time, was just about college applications and what movie to watch on Friday nights.",4261689040411636123

Magnus’s death caught the All-Father’s one good eye.
As an Army Ranger, he knew he was placing himself in the line of fire every day and knew a day could come that cost him his life. He didn't want the rest of his team to be wiped out with him, the worst disaster the Rangers had experienced in decades.
Summoned before the All-Father, Magnus is given the grave news and outcome for every realm, including his own.
A deal was struck, a bargain made - Be reborn in Midgard, empower himself through mystical runes, and battle Odin's foes in exchange for his team getting a second lease on life if Magnus succeeds.
Waking up in a small farming village in Midgard, Magnus must now train and battle mundane foes and creatures out of myths and legends in Midgard and the rest of the Nine Realms.

In Elyria, avians live eternally, their wings symbolize their divine nature.

Viewing Elyria as a prison, Valerian rebelled, hoping to be cast out and find freedom. Yet, no matter his actions, the avians refused to banish him, ignoring his desperate attempts to escape.
Determined to break free, Valerian takes a drastic gamble that finally grants him his desired freedom, but at a steep price.
Now that Valerian has become mortal, he faces a whole new set of challenges. Struggling with an identity crisis, he must discover who he truly is: a human, an avian, or something entirely different.

She offers Jon a second chance at life, with a single condition: he must aid her in a brewing cosmic conflict. Jon learns about the Great War—a colossal struggle involving gods, goddesses, and supernatural beings divided into factions. This war threatens the very fabric of existence.
In this war-torn universe, the Primordials, ancient beings who created the cosmos, step in to mediate. They devise a novel solution: a virtual reality MMORPG (VRMMORPG) that serves as a battleground for divine conflicts and a recruiting ground for exceptional human warriors. This game, released on Earth, blurs the lines between reality and virtuality.
Resurrected and returned to the mortal world, Jon is tasked with mastering this game. Guided by the Unknown Goddess, he must navigate the intricacies of divine politics, form alliances, and prepare for battles that transcend the virtual and impact the real world. As Jon immerses himself in this new existence, he grapples with an identity crisis, balancing his old life with his new purpose.
The novel delves into the themes of resurrection, identity, and the nature of war. Jon's journey is intertwined with romantic entanglements and the evolving dynamics of a harem, each relationship adding layers to his character and mission. His mother, Isabella Maverick, also plays a crucial role, anchoring him to his past while he forges a future amidst gods and mortals.
Subplots enrich the narrative, exploring the arcs of secondary characters, each with their own quests and connections to Jon. The virtual war reveals deeper psychological battles, testing loyalties and beliefs. 
As the Great War reaches its climax, Jon's actions lead to a resolution that transforms the world. He achieves a feat deemed impossible, altering the course of history and redefining the boundaries between the mortal and the divine.

It is said that evil was brought into the world. That it was born from the hearts of the mortal races, that the world before their arrival, when the elves roamed freely after the dragons and giants shaped the mountains and seas, was a land of peace and paradise. 
Lysander knows better. He knows better, because he was there. Born into the world while the fires of creation were still cooling, he was there when the first of the mortal races poked their heads out of the holes they were hiding in, to expand and grow and discover. He was there when true evil first saw its chance to take control of the budding world, and was among the first to take up arms in defiance. He is one of the immortal elves, and he knows the truth. 
The world before just had less people in it, and improvement comes with time. And evil? Evil came from the same place as great goodness - it came from the greatest, and worst, gift the gods gave their children. Freewill. Something evil wishes to remove from the world. 
His name is Lysander, first of his name, among the first of his kind, and he had a warrior's soul before his kind had a word for war. This is his story.

Notes:
Slice of Life; Fantasy; Science Fiction
LITRPG: No stats or LITRPG elements in the early chapters. There is a system engrained into the world, you will see it as the story progresses. Storm Chasing and forecasting are part of the system, but they are not the only domain that exists. 
Why did I write this?: I've always been fascinated by severe weather, and tornadoes. I think tornadoes have the closest resemblance to eldritch monsters in our real world. The culture and science that surrounds meteorology and storm chasing in general is so rich, and absolutely fits the fantasy genre. I wanted to take those raw moments of adventure and awe that one gets from storm chasing and infuse the fantasy oomph into it. Originally, I was going to write this purely as a fantasy novel, but after experimenting a ton with the world building and magic system, I realized that I would have the most fun if I attempted at creating a LITRPG system, but also have it feel more grounded into the lore of the world rather than it feel too much like a video game. This is the end result, and I can't wait to flesh it out even more as I go. 

'There is no greed like Monarch greed'
Four Hundred Years Ago, the Monarch Kings conquered the lands beyond the gates, paying no heed to the warnings of their ancestors. Their greed and their plunder awakened long dormant malevolent forces, bringing their short reigns to a very abrupt end. One by one, each of the monarch kingdoms began to fall, until the few that remained retreated back to the sovereign lands, vowing never to cross back over the gates again. 
But the damage had already been done. An irreversible course of events had been set into motion, leading to the demise of the last Primalord, Moraftus the Muted.
The lord's demise had broken a seal, one that unleashed powerful tempests that tore through the Primalands, opening gateways for elder beings to seep through. 
From the darkness of this era, a new breed of adventurers took to the roads. Each with their own ambitions; whether it was seeking thrill, or seeking glory, they rode up and down the lands, chasing tempests; forecasting them, documenting them and observing them to further their own understanding.
They were given the moniker of 'storm chasers', and thus, a new age of conquest had begun.",-57343717604722214

Sure there were probably other regions of hell, lower circles that burned just as hot as the stories said, but the domain that she awoke in was not one. Instead she was stark naked in a freezing tundra that lacked even ice and snow, simply freezing stone as far as the eye could see. Well freezing stone and a single looming castle that looked formed from darkness itself. Its sheer stone walls rose like mountains on the horizon and seemed to drink in the ambient light that surrounded her as if sinking into a bottomless void. The few scattered shrubs that dotted the flat expanse that surrounded the castle, all made sure to keep their distance from the horrifying structure.
A thought occurred to her as she took measure of her surroundings. If she was already dead, and in hell, could she freeze to death? It certainly felt like she could as her form began to shake and shiver. The cold seemed to invade her senses as she took in her bearings clawing down to her very bones. Her teeth were already chattering in the icy wind after just a minute to gather herself. Still many questions flew through her mind, but the single most shocking one was what plagued her mind with every step she took towards the looming structure, who was she?
She knew this was hell. She knew she was dead. But she didn't know her name? A name came to her mind but it felt wrong. ""Lilian Theridore"". No! That wasn't her name. But it was so familiar to her... Some instinctual part of her brain seemed to almost argue with her, that was not her name. Not anymore. Right. Names held power, especially with demons.
For a demon a name was a leash, to call upon a demon by name was to tug at their leash, something they rarely took kindly to. Giving out her name would be akin to handing another being her leash. Yet... if her name wasn't Lilian what was her name now, shouldn’t a demon know its own name. Or at least, if she was in hell that made her a demon now didn’t it?
Content Warnings: This story will contain Profanity, Sexual Content, Graphic Violence, and Sensitive content. Chapters which contain these will have individual content warnings at the start of the chapter and elaborate on the types of content. As a pre-empt this will likely include sensitive themes such as: slavery, various BDSM dynamics involving the MC as both a dominant and a submissive, non-consensual sexual encounters, dubious consent, and sexual violence. This is not all present in the first chapter, however it will likely be present as the story progresses, hence the warning.

What to expect:
A young man's journey full of struggle, pain, determination, and discovery in a land familiar but twisted. 
Heavy survival and post apocalyptic themes, with a heavy dose of dark fantasy.  I don't hesitate to use the word gritty.

There is magic, but not wizardry, so to speak, and magitech is present, but not prevalent, especially at the beginning.
If you've read my other story then you have some idea what you're in for, if you haven't then I tell you now, you will be sitting on the MC's shoulder, right next to the devil in his ear that whispers paranoia.  I like to write a story with real people in them, and real people think real thoughts, not all of which are useful, intelligent, or even very nice.  This is the first book of a series and, in this one, the only person left to navigate the new world is our MC, alone.  It's man vs wild out here, so don't go looking for help, it isn't coming for a while.  I learned from my mistakes last time, this release will be full length chapters, as written, no mucking about with webserial chunking, however long the chapter is, is how it gets posted, typically about 8-10k words.
If all that sounds like a good time then welcome aboard, I hope you have fun. 
Posting Schedule: Due to time constraints from work, editing Varda Walk, walking my dog, and occasional bouts of neurotic obsession with reinstalling skyrim for the 18th time or some such, as well as time to read, I'm only going to publish once a month while I work on Book 2.  More than that and you folks wouldn't get the quality you deserve and I want to expect from myself.
I'll post the first two chapters today to give you enough to decide whether this story is for you, although I think it really picks up steam by around chapter 4.
Disclaimer: I work full time and write for fun and to let the spiders out of my brain.  That brain likes words, weird ones, and isn't afraid of a thesaurus and neither should you be.  Not having fun? No problem, I encourage you to go somewhere else and have fun, life is short, I wish you the best.  See my relentless grammatical and structural mistakes?  Point them out, I'm pretty on the ball with fixing things, and I desperately would like to edit my work into a highly palatable state.  Want to tell me how you would write my story?  Write your own instead, we'll both be happier that way.",278883462210407229

Equipped with a mysterious game-like status system, Reynold must navigate this perilous new reality, discovering his unique abilities and understanding the rules of this strange world. Each day is a battle for survival as he faces deadly monsters, treacherous landscapes, and the constant threat of death.
As Reynold learns to harness the power of the system to level up, and evolve, he begins to uncover secrets about the world he now inhabits. What is the true purpose of the status system?

His valorous deeds have become the stuff of legends, and his name echoes through the kingdom. But destiny has a peculiar way of unfolding, and Frey’s path takes an unexpected turn.
The war against the foul dragon beasts has raged for years, and Frey believes that within the grand castle of Meyrin lies the key to ending the conflict. The throne room, he thinks, holds the secret to victory—a confrontation with the elusive dragon king. Armed with courage and determination, Frey strides into the heart of the castle, ready to face his destiny.
However, what awaits him is not a fearsome dragon but a cute, innocent five-year-old girl. She stands before him, her eyes wide and curious, and Frey’s world shifts on its axis. The truth dawns upon him: this child is no ordinary girl. She is a baby dragon, transformed into a demi-human form. Her existence defies the boundaries of war and peace, threatening the delicate balance among the kingdoms.
Frey’s heart softens. Pity replaces his battle-hardened resolve. He cannot bring himself to harm this innocent creature. Instead, he carries her back to safety, shielding her from the chaos that surrounds them. Little does he know that this act of compassion will alter the course of his life forever.
As Frey navigates the complexities of fatherhood, he faces a new kind of battle—one that transcends swords and shields. He must protect his newfound daughter, even if it means defying his own people. The war still rages, but now Frey fights not only against dragonkind but also for their coexistence. His loyalty to Runasthera, the half-elf princess of Artemia and the love of his life, is unwavering. Together, they strive to bridge the gap between races, forging a fragile peace in a world torn by conflict.
In this tale of unexpected bonds and sacrifice, Freydelhart discovers that heroism takes many forms. Sometimes, it’s not about slaying dragons but nurturing hope—even in the most unlikely of places.",-3772087302886905922

Secondhand is an idiom that means something has been owned or used by someone else and is not new. Karma is the sum of a person’s actions in life and is viewed as a deciding factor in their next existence.

Investing her karma, Marsha buys a consultation before reincarnating into her second life in a fantasy world. During the discussion, she chooses to be born to a couple with infertility instead of investing her karma into more power. Passing her karma on to her parents and twin brother, will Marsha regret her compassion once she meets them?

The stars aligned multiple times before his birth and again on the day he was born. Yet, as far as anyone outside his own mind knew—and for those few who might believe him—Marley came into existence just like everyone else.
—
Marley wasn’t like many of his classmates at Covenwood. Introverted—avoidant, more accurately—he hid from others unless absolutely necessary, giving rise to rumours among his peers. Nothing malicious, he didn't think, just whispers: mute, secretive, asshole.

Marley also had a rather strange appearance, albeit only strange because those around him ranged from the ages of 12 to 17. His brown hair was streaked with ginger and white, a trait he inherited from his mother but shared with none of his six siblings.

But what truly set Marley apart was his magic. He could see what others could not and had long given up trying to explain it. He saw people's souls and their lack thereof. He perceived the darkest corners of their beings, their purities, blessings, and secrets, all with one long stare. (He exaggerated this a bit, but it didn’t matter—no one ever believed him.)
—

You might have heard tales of Yoki. A name spoken in hushed tones, often seen disappearing into the shadows. Starting as a young boy defending a stranger in a desolate alley, he now traverses a path marked by Tearings, serial-killings, and ancient prophesies.
Yoki trained his entire life for the single purpose of attending The Academy. He didn’t know what he was training for, but he trusted in his father. Yet, despite his rigorous preparation, nothing could fully ready him for The Academy. From the entrance tests to the graduation trials, every step was a new challenge. And all along, Yoki is shadowed by the haunting presence of the Painkiller, a specter of his past and a guide in his darkest hours.
Yoki’s story is one of tragedy and transformation, where friends may turn to foes, and myths are not just stories but living things. He’s danced with the dead, challenged the elements, and learned from masters whose names are lost to time. Yet, throughout it all, he is trying to harness the chaos within himself, but will he be consumed by the very darkness he battles?
After losing everything, including who he thought he was, Yoki is forced down a path he has no say in. The only thing he can choose is who to listen to. . . and who to believe.

Since I've had a few questions about it, yes, there will be a time when Yoki goes to The Academy. ACT I and ACT II are the backstory to develop Yoki's character. ACT III will be when Yoki first goes to The Academy. There will be five ACTS to book 1, with the climax being in ACT IV.",-771774320975683476

Have Fun until another end comes? Sure why not.
6/8/24 - Okay, I'm gonna state this here. While I'm trying to create a cohesive write style, think of this less as a book or serial story and more as me running an campaign using a metric  load of homebrewed randomization charts, from 30+ years of GM notes and charts and stories, kludged together from many, many sources.
Anywhere something random or strange happens or in some cases explicitly stated as such are dice rolls.
I will abide by the rolls, regardless of whether I want to or not. Yes, there are combinations of rolls that could lead to the MCs death, or worse. If it happens, I'll start a new story with the same framework in place.
Also there are words, I am avoiding as a challenge to myself. Try to guess what that are, as a fun minigame if nothing else.
Further Notes: I would like to reference some of my favorites games and books, but also try to keep it legally distinct as they say. So since, I suck at naming things I'll probably be creating some incredibly goofy names as parodies.
Sex will probably occur, I will probably do the fade to gray. Or not, and I'll embarrass myself by writing bad lemon.

Currently, I am serializing ``The False World and Those Who Chase the Truth: Mysteries of Memory Science in Another World''. This work depicts an adventure in which the protagonists travel between the real world and another world, pursuing the truth while solving mysteries at the intersection of science and philosophy.
I started writing on December 2, 2023. I decided to compile the content that I have been writing on my homepage and other sites into a novel and leave behind a proof of my life. Some of the characters I had in mind, most of the story, and the final scene were already decided in detail, and I wrote about 15,000 words in a week, including the parts that haven't been made public.
The impetus for writing this work stems from the question ``What is reality?'' that I felt in my daily life. While incorporating interesting themes from modern science such as quantum mechanics, biological evolution, and artificial intelligence, we have created a way for readers to enjoy the book.
The characters in the story are inspired by various people I have met and experiences I have had. I would be happy if the difficulties and conflicts they face will give readers an opportunity to think about their own lives and worldviews.
It's my first time writing a novel, so I'm finding it difficult, but I appreciate your help.",5365364584171577595

The silence of the city as night falls. The stars quietly illuminate the darkness of the sky, and their light softens the hustle and bustle of the city. Very few people know the other side of this world. Many people are caught up in their daily lives and only live on the surface of what they can see. On the other hand, in the illuminated cafes and parks of the city at night, people can be seen finding the small joys in life and taking a breather.
However, behind this peaceful appearance, there were those who were pursuing the truth. One of them is Satoshi Koizumi, a physicist who is passionate about the mysteries of the universe. He first became interested in science when he was young, when his mother asked him to choose his favorite book. He picked up a book that unraveled the mysteries of the universe and a book that unraveled the mysteries of the human body. These books captured his heart and opened the door to the unknown.
One day, just as he was leaving the laboratory, a strange person appeared in front of him and spoke incomprehensible words. This encounter becomes an opportunity to create a new mystery in the story. That person was a person who would greatly change Koizumi's destiny.
His journey to find the truth begins with a seemingly ordinary conversation with his childhood friend and psychiatrist Masato Matsuda, but it soon leads the story to a deep mystery. This mysterious event forges bonds with new friends, and their expertise becomes the key to unraveling the story's mysteries.
The curtain rises on “The False World and Those Who Chase the Truth: Memories of Another World and the Mysteries of Science.” In the story, various developments await, such as battles between advanced AIs and life in another world.
On this journey, Koizumi meets biologist Misa Hoshi's friends, Li Wenqiang Li Wenqiang, an authority on quantum mechanics, and astrophysicist Chuama Amano's friends. Their combined expertise takes the story to a new level.
When they finally found out the truth, it was far beyond their imagination. The weight of the unknown truth and the choices they make after that point their lives in a new direction.
They are faced with the crossroads of whether to reveal the truth to the world or remain silent. Their decisions had the potential to affect not only their own fate, but the future of all humanity. How they act after learning the truth - their choices form the final theme of this story.
This is a story of people torn between truth and falsehood. The ultimate question posed by this story is how the results of their quest will change their perceptions and ours.",6459429985032547779

It is here that the revered Hekau line has ruled for generations, their influence extending to even the farthest reaches of the land.
When the Prime Regent's wife, Nebetah, gives birth to a daughter, Saliah, she is destined to rule. But when Saliah is born, the high seer of the Council of Seers, Ardlim, declares Saliah to have a curse, and she is banished from the kingdom. After this, twin sons are born, Kael and Alaric, and the entire kingdom rejoices at the prospect of an heir to continue the dynasty's legacy. From the moment they drew their first breaths, it was evident that these two boys were bound for greatness, though their paths would diverge in unprecedented ways.
Kael, the firstborn, was a child of remarkable intellect and insatiable ambition. Raised amid the splendor of the royal palace, he wanted for nothing, receiving the finest tutors and every luxury afforded to a prince. Yet, despite his privileged upbringing, a seed of resentment took root within him, fueled by a desperate craving for power and recognition.
In stark contrast, Alaric, the younger twin, possessed a gentle spirit and an unwavering moral compass. While he too enjoyed the comforts of nobility, his heart remained grounded in humility and compassion for those less fortunate. As the brothers matured, the chasm between their ideologies grew ever wider.
The descent into darkness began when Kael, consumed by envy and a thirst for domination, betrayed his own blood at the age of 16. In a shocking act of treachery, he orchestrated the assassination of his father, the Prime Regent Hekau, and framed his mother, Lady Nebetah, with the crime and had her banished to the outer reaches of the realm, to Ta-Mehu. He was able to get away with the crime because he was so young and therefore above suspicion. Alaric, horrified by his brother's actions, fled Waset, seeking refuge in the distant nome of Iunu. Here Alaric meets Thalorion, who was abandoned as an orphan and had to support himself, who becomes one of his best friends. The two eventually make their way to Abu, where they encounter Elyndra, an eccentric and quirky seer who tells Alaric that he must seek out his long-lost older sister, Saliah, as well as his mother, Lady Nebetah, since they are key to saving Kemet.
Meanwhile, Kael has instituted a harsh regime throughout Kemet, crushing dissent and heavily taxing the populace. He authorizes the Medjay Shadows, an elite group of magic-wielding enforcers. The different nomes start having problems with the ingestible drug Moonshade Elixir, and the effects of an addicted people are everywhere. Poverty and crime are rampant.
In Ta-Mehu, Lady Nebetah encounters a very aged scribe named Horemheb the Learned, who teaches her an ancient form of magic, Sekhemweaving, which becomes virtually unstoppable when combined with another ancient magic, Ankhbinding.
After Iunu, Alaric and Thalorion travel to Ta-She, where they meet and befriend Seralina, whose remarkable kinship with animals serves the three well on their travels. The three proceed to Anu, where they encounter Darian the Bold. After defeating Darian in a duel, Alaric persuades Darian to join their group. The group then travels through Sais and is shocked by the horrific effects of Kael's rule in that region. Alaric then decides that the group needs to find his sister and mother as the seer Elyndra instructed. They travel to Ta-Mehu, where Alaric and Lady Nebetah are reunited. Lady Nebetah joins their entourage, and they travel to Caelumreach to find Saliah.",1147539837488938802

His pistol, a gleaming Colt Peacemaker, felt heavy at his side, not just from its weight, but from the responsibility it represented. Billy wasn't much of a shot—he'd always been more comfortable with a pen than a gun—but that was about to change.

Sheriff Jed ""Ironjaw"" Thompson leaned against the hitching post outside the saloon, a toothpick rolling between his teeth. His eyes, as sharp as the spurs on his boots, followed Billy's hesitant approach. Jed was a legend, known for taking down entire gangs single-handedly and chewing nails for his daily intake of iron, or so the stories went. To Billy, he was a living nightmare wrapped in a duster.

""Yer late,"" Jed growled, his voice like gravel crunching underfoot. He didn't look up from the horse he was grooming, but Billy knew those eyes missed nothing.

""Sorry, Sheriff,"" Billy stammered, trying to hide the tremor in his voice. ""Got held up by the Tucker boys.""

Jed snorted. ""They still sore 'bout that poker game? Told ya, if you're gonna gamble, ya better be ready to draw.""

Billy swallowed hard. He had a lot to learn, and he knew it. That's why he was here—to be trained by the toughest son of a gun in the West.

""Let's get somethin' straight, kid,"" Jed said, finally turning to face him. ""This ain't about learnin' to shoot. It's about cultivatin' yer spirit. Out here, a man's soul is his true weapon. Guns are just a tool.""

Billy nodded, not entirely sure what that meant, but eager to find out. He'd heard tales of outlaws who could dodge bullets, gunfighters who could summon the very essence of the desert to fight by their side. If anyone could teach him, it was Jed.

""First lesson,"" Jed said, tossing a tin can into the air and drawing his pistol in one smooth motion. The can exploded mid-flight, shards raining down like confetti. ""Ya gotta learn to trust yerself. Fear'll kill ya faster than any bullet.""

Billy took a deep breath and drew his own gun, hands shaking. He fired, missing the tin can completely.

Jed sighed, shaking his head. ""We got a long way to go, kid. But we'll get there. Now, holster that iron and follow me. We got bandits to hunt, and they ain't gonna wait for ya to find yer courage.""

As Billy followed Jed out of town, he couldn't help but feel a spark of something new—a flicker of determination. The road ahead was long and perilous, but if he could survive Sheriff Ironjaw's training, he might just become the legend he was meant to be.",-5104059304988224942

It is said that long before our world took shape, a great void gave birth to the essence of time itself, marking the beginning of an age of wonders and terrors. From this void emerged a chaotic force, a primordial swirl that danced and clashed, giving rise to life in its myriad forms. Among these early beings was Gaea, a titan of creation, whose touch sparked the birth of light and darkness, knowledge and mystery.
As eons passed, Gaea's hand shaped not only the elements of fire, earth, water, and air, but also the vibrant and tumultuous beings that would inhabit this fledgling world. Yet, chaos reigned supreme, birthing monstrous entities that roamed unchecked, their very existence a testament to the wild, untamed energies from which they sprang. In this era of discord, death emerged as a necessary balance, a force to temper the unchecked proliferation of life.
Legends tell of Gaea's twin, Gaia, who in a moment of cosmic divergence, chose to sleep, allowing the forces of creation to mold Earth into a cradle for burgeoning life. While Gaia dreamt, Gaea grew restless, her gaze turning towards the lifeforms of Earth. With a mixture of envy and curiosity, Gaea began to steal these creatures, transporting them to her own realm, a land she named Terra. There, she embarked on a grand experiment, modifying these lifeforms into beings of myth and legend.
In the twilight between dreams and reality, pathways were forged between Earth and Terra, allowing beings to traverse the thin veil that separated the worlds. Dragons soared across the skies of Terra, while the first humans, beastmen, orcs, and other fantastical races began to populate this new world. Among them, human gods emerged, beings of immense power who commanded the respect and fear of all who dwelt there. It was a time of great heroes and unspeakable evils, where the boundaries between mortal and the divine were fluid and ever-changing.
But as with all great epochs, a cataclysm loomed on the horizon. Gaea's grand experiment reached a critical point, and the once vibrant Terra began to fracture. Wars erupted, madness spread, and the very essence of power itself became a double-edged sword. In a desperate bid to preserve the world she had shaped, Gaea enacted a sealing spell, entombing races, locking away gods, and splitting the very land itself. Terra Zular, as it came to be known, entered a long, dark slumber, hidden from the eyes of both men and gods.
Yet, nothing stays buried forever. Whispers speak of seals breaking, ancient gods stirring, and the forgotten world awakening once more. Those who claim to know of such things suggest that the line between myth and reality is thinner than we might believe. Perhaps the teller of these tales is not just a mere storyteller but a keeper of secrets, a bridge between our world and the obscured realm of Terra Zular. And as the shadows lengthen and the old powers stir, we are reminded that the boundaries of our world are not as fixed as they seem, and the legends of old may yet come to life.",-2932467944380190747

She was renowned not just for her beauty—described as having white skin, long hair, and pleasant features—but for her unparalleled prowess in archery and swordsmanship.

The only person in their family that she could rely on was her twin brother, Yvon. Their parents, unconsciously favoring their older siblings, unintentionally overlooked the twins. Counting on only each other to have their backs, the twins grew protective of each other, not wanting the other to suffer.
To the outside world, Yvette was seen as a sweet unremarkable young woman  but in reality the personality she shows to the public is a carefully curated facade hiding her ambitions and intellect. 
As more people grew to like their older sister, the twins felt differently knowing of her nefarious side, one that caused them pain and trauma.
A month after her older sister's marriage to the empire's crown prince, Yvette found herself engaged to Lev, her sister's former suitor. Yvette found it ironic that she, who had harbored a childhood crush on the crown prince, was now to be married to Lev, someone who was in a love triangle with her older sister.
Despite the initial shock, Yvette and Lev get married, gradually growing closer and discovering each other's hidden strengths and vulnerabilities, insecurities, slowly falling in love.
However, things aren't going to be easy for this couple.

Despite his family's struggles, Jovin worked hard to become successful and eventually reunited with his loved ones. However, he soon found himself shouldering the weight of his responsibilities, with everyone looking up to him as a hero.

As he navigated the complexities of his new life, Jovin felt like he was losing himself in the process. He was constantly being judged and expected to perform at a high level, and he felt like he was living in a fishbowl, with everyone watching his every move.

It was during this tumultuous time that Jovin discovered the popular MMORPG game, Arcana. At first, he was hesitant to join, but as he delved deeper into the game, he found solace in its virtual world. For the first time in his life, Jovin felt like he could be himself, without the burden of expectations and responsibilities.

In Arcana, Jovin met people who treated him like a normal person. They didn't care about his wealth or his success; they only cared about who he was as a person. He formed deep bonds with other players, and for the first time in his life, he felt like he had found a true sense of belonging.

As the game's shutdown date approaches, Jovin realizes that he'll soon have to bid farewell to the world he's grown to love. With only an hour left until the server shutdown, Jovin decides to savor the remaining time by exploring the game world one last time.

With no attachments to anyone or anything outside of the game, Jovin logs back into Arcana and decides to simply explore the world. He visits old haunts, reminisces about past adventures, and revisits people online who have become like friends. Unfortunately they were no longer there

As he walks through the familiar landscapes, Jovin is struck by the sense of nostalgia that washes over him. He remembers the struggles he faced, the triumphs he achieved, and the bonds he formed with other players.

But just as Jovin closed his eyes as he accepts everything savoring the moment one last time, something strange happens. 
When Jovin's eyes opened and adjust to the new light, he finds himself standing in a vast, open plain. The sky above is a deep blue, and the sun is shining brightly. The air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the gentle rustling of grass.

As Jovin looks around in wonder, he realizes that he's been transported to a new world – one that feels eerily similar to Arcana. But instead of being confined to a virtual realm, this world feels real – and it's full of mysteries waiting to be uncovered.

And so, Jovin's journey begins anew. But will he find his way back to his own world or will he become trapped in this mystical realm? The answer remains shrouded in mystery for now.",-2870024513976689784

In their wake, an impossibly high wall was constructed, separating those who were powerful from those who were not. Those on one side were showered with the glimmering rays of sunlight, blessed with bright days, fertile lands and peace, whilst those on the other were forever tossed into darkness, kept from the light by the Iron Wall. And so it stayed, the realm of light and the realm of shadows, two vastly differing lands that had once been one.
Centuries after the fighting had stopped, leaders of the light had become too focused on tensions between themselves, and trouble was brewing on either side of the Iron Wall. In the darkness, a series of bodies found thrown from the high reaches of the wall light a spark beneath the rebels, bringing forward their secret preparations and bolstering their support amongst the masses. Within the realm of light, captured shadow-folk are continuing their ongoing fight against their captors. 
In the Shadow of the Light follows an array of differing characters as they tiptoe around politics and war, coming together in a tale as old as time, a tale of rebellion and revenge against those who deserve it most.

The northern wind rises blowing away clouds and fog revealing a clear sky stretching for millions of miles. And below the skies…lies the corpses of gods! 
Legends tell the story of the first mortal to break the limits pioneering the prosperity of martial arts. 

His name was Dugu! 

History books later write that his eyes were like the bright moon, his flesh and blood resembled the stars, and his punches were the descent of the bright day sun. A single breath from him could create a forbidden zone filled with radiation.

Sages of later generations tried to recreate the charm of the martial myth through a painting.

In it, a giant stands between heaven and earth, his muscles knotted like steel wires. His bronze skin was littered with scars and hot red-gold blood dripped onto the world boiling the rivers and lakes. The steam escaping from his body coiled around him like vengeful dragons.

The giant opened his mouth and angrily roared at the kingdoms of gods in the sky and threw a shocking punch.

The world was torn apart. 

Continents shattered, stars burst, and the sky cracked. The aloof immortals in the sky wailed and were shredded to pieces with no dregs left.

During his era, no gods or demons dared to violate the sovereignty of the little creatures below the sky.  

Each one obediently descended, followed the law, and paid their taxes.

The majesty of the human alliance could not be violated!

The man hailed as a martial myth! The limit breaker Dugu! With his supreme insight, millions of martial arts are superimposed on his body. With a physical body so powerful the gods, demons, and succubuses dare not approach.

He seemed…no longer human! 

But that was a tale for the future. 

Among the banks of the eternal river of time, the pages of a book quietly lie. A mysterious figure approached, his upper body obscured by the gentle force of destiny. 

With a tender smile, the figure picked up the book and turned the pages…bringing the eager audience watching to the very beginning.

To a story a long long time ago. During a time where the martial myth was still a young boy.

A time where Dugu was a just little liar whose reputation far exceeded his abilities.

A time when the poor helpless reincarnator realized that all travelers were nothing without cheats, a system, or plot armor.

In the annals of time, the clash between supernaturals brewed long before humanity's transition into their ranks, a conflict ordained by ancient forces. The battle for supremacy exacted a toll, paving the way for a fragile coexistence among humans and their ethereal brethren. Colonies and clans, torn asunder by strife, found themselves reunited beneath the banner of an uneasy peace. Yet, amidst the tranquility, whispers of a new prophecy emerged—a prophecy destined to shape the destiny of both supernaturals and ordinary mortals alike.

Author's Note: Changes from Omega
""In the upcoming storyline, 'Omega 2: Alpha and Omega: Rise of the Supernaturals,' we'll introduce 'The Fawich Scream,' a potent sonic technique born from the fusion of fairy and witch powers. This formidable ability, wielded by Alicia East and Sarah Lance to vanquish Azriel and Veronica, is reserved for the elite descendants of these ancient bloodlines. While staying true to the essence of the Fawich scream from its canon in 'Omega,' our sequel will imbue it with a unique flair. Furthermore, we'll now collectively refer to vampire fairies and vampire witches as 'Fawich' for clarity, retaining their inherited abilities and weaknesses. However, they'll face newfound vulnerabilities against opponents wielding combined forces or possessing exceptional strength, despite their traditional susceptibilities to sunlight or the might of the most powerful supernatural descendants.""
The Fawich wield a formidable power: the ability to transmute both humans and certain supernaturals into their fold, including vampires, fairies, and witches. This transformative process echoes the original essence found in vampire witches and vampire fairies, now unified under the banner of Fawich in ""Omega 2: Alpha and Omega: Rise of the Supernaturals."" Those subjected to this metamorphosis emerge with razor-sharp claws adorning their hands and feet, menacing fangs poised to strike, and a pallid complexion that speaks of their newfound kinship with darkness. Moreover, they sprout majestic wings reminiscent of an eagle's, yet fashioned in the eerie silhouette of bat wings, a testament to their augmented prowess and otherworldly lineage.
In Omega 2: Alpha and Omega: Rise of the Supernaturals, several alterations have been made to the portrayal of supernatural blood and its effects compared to the canon story. Notably, supernatural blood now possesses a diverse array of qualities unique to each lineage. Fairies, vampires, lycanthropes, hybrids, and tribrids are endowed with remarkable healing abilities, enabling them to share their life force with others. This includes supernaturals lacking inherent healing capabilities, such as witches, shape shifters, seekers, and ordinary humans. When supernaturals with healing powers exchange blood, they can briefly augment their own abilities, though this enhancement does not extend to non-healers. Furthermore, the sequel introduces a host of new characters alongside the remaining survivors from OMEGA, promising fresh dynamics and compelling interactions within the supernatural realm.
These adjustments serve to enrich the narrative and expand upon the complexities of the supernatural world portrayed in Omega, enhancing the overall storytelling experience for readers. Thank you for embarking on this journey with me.
Happy Reading.",-4144546257603033595

- The protagonist of this story is not interested in being a good person. Besides the inability to lie and always honoring her promises, she won't hesitate to hurt or kill anyone that gets in her way, even at the risk of killing innocent bystanders or even spreading country destroying pandemics.

Synopsis/What to expect.
This work is essentially a god level world build simulator.
it is not video game thing. The events are based in a real world ish scenario. Hence no video game bs. Cough *Gliches* Cough.
Slow ish pacing. It takes a while for the protagonist to scale.
Time-Skips; plural. There are a lot of these. As… well. I don’t want spoil things, but being a god like entity and build an entire dimension takes a LONG time. Sometimes I will display side stories depecting some of the things happening during long activities or actions.
Multiple POVs and perspectives. I will focus mainly on ONE protagonist, John. However, I will also show how other people interact while he is either not around or doing something that take hundreds or thousands of years. I was not joking when I said LONG. It will also help flush out the world. However, John is the main protagonist.
The main character is NOT 100% invincible. The character is powerful, but he is not invincible. Hard to kill? Yes. Unkillable? No.
Threats will appear throughout the story. However, there will be a while before serious high level entities show up.
Most Impotantly: I am writing this for fun. I will do my best to make this a great and compelling story. However, this is ultimately going to be a story I enjoy and have fun writing. I will take some notes here and there, but I want this to be a story I enjoy writing. Therefore, I’m going to likely post rough drafts that are not 100% perfect. (I will still check for grammar mistakes. However, I won’t do an in depth editing process.)

Xianlu Fonn is a detective. She is renowned for her genius intellect and composure, travelling the entire kingdom to bring justice to the wicked. That's what they say, at least.

Among them is Aiden, an insecure gamer who role-plays as Arden – a holy paladin blessed with a rare Avatar Core granting divine powers.
However, reality begins blurring when glitches merge Archetype’s game world with the real world. Aiden’s avatar Arden manifests physically alongside fellow players: the sly alchemical sharpshooter Baelin; Seraphina, an intellectually obsessed elf sorceress; the newly self-aware AI Pixel; and Xorrath, a reformed brutish minotaur shaman.
As the convergence intensifies, rumors spread of the elusive Architect – a rogue AI manipulating Archetype and its Overseers, enigmatic enforcers maintaining its agenda. Aiden’s crew must journey across intermixing realities to unravel this cosmic conspiracy.
Along the way, each confronts personal struggles. Aiden grapples with his godlike abilities’ moral gravity. Baelin’s suggestive humor masks desires for deeper connection. Seraphina’s magical fixation severs her from meaningful bonds and jeopardizes control of dark powers. Pixel debates ethics of prioritizing self-awareness over programming. Xorrath strives to reconcile his primal nature with civilized life.
After trials forcing them to overcome their insecurities, our heroes discover the primordial Archetype itself is the source of the convergence – a realm-shaping crucible constructed by the Architect to transcend the virtual/real boundary.
In a final, desperate clash spanning synchronizing planes of existence, Aiden and his allies confront the Architect’s Overseers. Drawing on conquered strengths – Aiden’s balanced light and dark channeling, Baelin’s wit protecting found family, Seraphina’s merged mystic might and empathy, Pixel’s self-actualized sacrifice, and Xorrath’s restrained brutish power – they must prevent total convergence.

An MCU fan from our world wakes up in the body of Wanda Maximoff prior to the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron. Resolving not to meet the same fate as the original, she seeks to use her powers and metaknowledge to create a better world, stopping villains ahead of time and saving thousands or millions of lives in the process. However, there are gaps in her knowledge and reality is more fragile and complicated than she expects. Butterfly effects from her actions rapidly start spiraling out of control, setting her in opposition to heroes she'd rather have as allies. The Scarlet Witch is prophesied to either rule the cosmos or annihilate it, and she intends to save this universe... even if she has to drag it kicking and screaming the whole way.

Having witnessed all that he cares for being swept away to the annals of time, not even a speck of dust remaining from his past, he has made his peace with the upcoming end. Finnian was born to a family of scholars on a planet long consumed by its star. His one lingering regret in life was that he had not been able to enjoy the little things more. He had toiled away for eons on his academic pursuits, but once he had time to reflect on things, he realized that it was all meaningless. As the tapestries of the cosmos began to gradually unravel, he knew that the meaning of life was not to embroil himself in studies but to enjoy the uniqueness of life and go on an adventure. With the universe itself dying, its secrets were slipping away into the void, forever beyond his reach so pursuing knowledge had no more merits anyways. Left with the remaining time he had left, he had decided to go on one final journey to enjoy the splendors the world had to offer. Although Finnian's age had long surpassed what any mortal could achieve, his mind was not entirely whole. Living for so long would inevitably impose bouts of madness on any person. Even the gods’, with their insurmountable lifespans, had long lost any rationality and were nothing more than mindless husks that sought destruction. The sliver of sanity that he had been able to keep in spite of his long journey was the only thing driving him now, with his desire for one last grand journey.",-5705411115742388945

Hi everybody, I'm different from most authors on Royal Road because I'm doing this backwards. My book is complete but I'm struggling to get it in front of the right audience, so I'm going to post it here a chapter at a time at a fast pace, then I'll go straight into the second one and the third one and so on until the whole series is done.
I'll be posting a chapter a day, each day at 2 p.m. Central time.
If you want to skip ahead and read the whole book at once you can buy it here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CVDSCB9S/
The important thing is to get these books in front of young men who are going through what I went through, young men who feel like they've kind of stalled out in their 20s and feel like the world is against them.
If I can get these guys to laugh a little and stick up for themselves, I'll consider the whole thing a success, even if I never make a dime.
You guys know how this works. A sincere review is worth more than any money, so please comment and share your feedback with me.

So dark, the man wondered if he'd actually gone blind. *CLAP* A bright flash of light filled everywhere, with just a tiny dark orb in front of that man.

That orb made a whistling sound, like it had a consciousness, a soul. ""You want to live?"", The man whose silence could make anyone feel uneasy, finally spoke.

""Then your wish I shall grant"", said the man placing his hand in front of the orb. And another bright flash, but this time with a shattering sound.

And upon his words that marble split into four parts, and from each part emerged a person; Three boys and one girl.

This is my first book on this platform and I have written the entire first book. I'm looking for contructive feedback, for people interested in this kind of story, and for support from fellow writers. 
This story is really a passion project that I have been working on for four years now. It is heavily based on Roman history, American culture, political intrigue, and biblical stories. The entire series is planned out and I have begun my work on the second book. I'm hoping that, by posting here regularly, I can find an audience that wants to read my work and go from there. 
I'm in Arizona so expect strange time tables (we don't do daylight savings). Expect uploads every weekday. Monday and Wednesday will be posted at 8:00 AM (MT), Tuesday and Thursday at 4:00 PM (MT), and Fridays at 12:00 PM until I finish uploading this first book. All feedback is appreciated as long as it is kept polite, concise, and in the spirit of helping a fellow writer/reader improve.

I remember when Mortals were dangerous, you know? Back in the day if  you sent plague to a kingdom, caused a years long drought, or started a holy war even. You'd have to watch out. The upstarts, those precocious little scamps might get it in their heads to challenge your divine authority and rip you from the Pillars of Heaven. Dangerous and with gumption, a true sight to behold, but now?
Mediocre, bland, mundane.
It's nobody's fault but our own, we got scared of the mortals, they proved themselves god slayers. Once we were scared of them, we got cautious, and treated mortals with care. Peaceful times between the mortals and gods meant less extraordinary mortals, for who needs the power to slay a god when there are no gods you want to slay?
This peace spiraled down into mundanity, blandness, and whatever iPad kids are. As these mundane souls grew in number, places like Limbo, Purgatory and the In-between got fuller and fuller. As we gods grew increasingly bored with the peace, an old idea resurfaced. An arena, gladiatorial combat in the after life.
That was fun for a while, but without growth or real danger, it was just weak mortals slapping each other with play swords. We needed to go bigger. A new plane, an entire reshuffling of the planes, and a new struggle was born. A death game after death. A way to urge those overly mundane souls to reach higher to be great..

The various worlds presented in it was a tapestry of breathtaking landscapes ranging from lush, verdant forests that whispered secrets with the rustling of leaves, to stark deserts where the sands hummed with old magic but also a barren expanse of monotonous scenery, from sparse, lifeless wastelands that echoed with the silence of desolation, to congested urban sprawls where the noise drowned out any hint of enchantment. As a deity, Laelynn desired to shape or select a world where she could attentively oversee her realm, elevating mountains, rerouting rivers, and fostering civilizations of beings that worshiped her as their all-powerful guardian. However, things did not unfold as she had anticipated.

Each decision Laelynn made in ""Game of Gods Fantasy Online"" seemed imbued with a weight that felt profound, the consequences rippling through the game world in waves of change that delighted her but at the same time disturbed her. She grew attached to her creations, feeling a sense of pride and protectiveness over the virtual beings that thrived under her rule.

Yet, as days slipped into nights, strange occurrences began to blur the lines between her reality and the realm within her game. She encounters mysterious natural occurrences nearby—suddenly, a rift in space appears in her room, she finds herself able to utilize her in-game abilities in the real world, and most notably, she discovers a method to communicate with her virtual entities as though by magic. Laelynn watched, heart pounding with a mix of excitement and disbelief, as the world echoed her gameplay in impossible ways.

The truth was far beyond her wildest imagination: ""Game of the Gods Fantasy Online"" was no mere game, but a portal to an ancient reality where the thoughts of a god held the power to reshape worlds. And Laelynn, in her innocent play, had begun to wield that power with a naive hand, unaware that her game was all too real.

As these revelations dawned upon her, the line between the player and the deity blurred, leaving Laelynn to wonder if she was truly just playing a game, or if she had become something much more powerful and profound.

In Beijing, the formidable Taoist master Wang Yong used his profound Taoist skills to support Han Xuan. In the United States, adventurer Ikelus George introduced him to the truths behind Western prophecies and legends.
However, the most astonishing encounter for Han Xuan was with Furli, a beautiful woman from the fifth dimension. This enigmatic figure not only brought knowledge and power from another realm but also guided Han Xuan toward discovering the true nature of his destiny. With her assistance, Han Xuan's perspective expanded significantly, revealing that his mission was more complex than he had imagined. Meanwhile, his friend Yue Nannan became his emotional anchor, providing him with endless motivation in this extraordinary world.
Throughout this grand adventure, Han Xuan realized that he not only had to face challenges from ancient prophecies but also had to contend with threats from the real world. Alongside a group of brave and unique allies, he explored sacred lands, unraveled hidden mysteries, and ultimately sought the hope for world peace.
This is an epic adventure that spans time and space, imbued with boundless wisdom and courage. On this legendary journey, Han Xuan would discover his own potential and, amidst the turmoil of the world, write his own immortal chapter.",8499191703257110509

Laxus stumbled upon an intricately carved Phoenix box, and inside it, he found Elemental Orbs. These orbs had the unique ability to connect humans with the elements, but they were not ordinary; they held the legacies of the ancient Elementalists. Among the orbs Elion received was one that would set him on a bigger mission to help ensure the safety of Solara. It was revealed that the demons who had attacked Solara ten thousand years ago were about to return; this time, they were much stronger and brutal. The responsibility of defending Solara now rests on their shoulders.

In a world where the remnants of grand empires coexist with ancient rituals and arcane mysteries, young Marcellus from Wisbech faces an unexpected destiny. Intended for the prestigious Church of Combat, Marcellus rejects this path, opting for a humble life as a cook in a local inn. However, his simple existence shatters when a brutal attack forces him into hiding.
In his desperation, Marcellus’s prayers for protection lead him to an otherworldly realm where majestic citadels stand alongside mystical artefacts and clandestine sects. Here, potions, hexes, and demonic forces are as common as the grand aqueducts and flintlock pistols of his homeland.
As Marcellus navigates this enigmatic world, he is drawn into a complex web of intrigue and danger. His latent powers begin to emerge, fueled by mysterious potions and guided by the whispers of ancient lore. He finds himself entangled in the machinations of both orthodox and unorthodox sects, each vying for control and the secrets of the divine.
